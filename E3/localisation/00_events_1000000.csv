EVTDESC1010011;For years, British committees have looked into the situation in Ireland and predicted disaster: the Irish farmers had become more and more dependent on their potato crop, and if anything were to happen to that crop it would cause not only widespread chaos throughout the Irish economy but famine and worse. Their predictions have come true. A blight has been spreading, leading to failure after failure of the Irish potato harvest. Proponents of laissez-faire economics are adamant that the market will provide food for those affected, and that the government should not interfere in private enterprise. Others claim that no expense is too high to help the Irish, and that failure to act quickly will lead to starvation and resentment… but conservatives are quick to dismiss this as inflammatory nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC1010012;The blight affecting the Irish potato crop has spread to $STATENAME$. With the local harvest quickly failing, the effects are already being felt-poor Irish peasants are walking the streets of $PROVINCENAME$, begging for government aid which never arrives, and many are obviously considering making their way to the New World out of desperation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC1010013;The blight affecting the Irish potato crop has spread to $STATENAME$.

EVTDESC1010014;The blight affecting the Irish potato crop has spread to $STATENAME$. With the local harvest quickly failing, the effects are already being felt-in $PROVINCENAME$, the Irish are gathering in large crowds to receive aid sent by the British government. While they are grateful, times are still incredibly difficult and it’s clear many are considering leaving Ireland to take their chances in the New World.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010015;An aborted attempt at an uprising recently took place in the village of Ballingarry, Ireland. A group of Irish nationalists, frustrated by what they call the inept handling of the recent famine by the British government, engaged in a long gunfight with a unit of constabulary until reinforcements arrived and drove the men off. Many of these nationalists have since been captured and tried, but the event has sparked an increase in nationalism across the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA1010015;Outrageous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010016;Not content to wait until the dust of the war has settled, nationalists in Ireland have taken to the streets of $PROVINCENAME$ to call for the end of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. With our forces engaged elsewhere, their calls have quickly swept across all of $STATENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1010016;Ireland’s Opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1010016;When the war is done, there shall be consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010020;The tone among the people in our Irish territories has changed. Many Irish nationalist who emigrated to the United States founded a militant organization called the Fenian Brotherhood there, a group dedicated to freeing Ireland from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control… and now they have formed a sister organization back home, the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Already they are stirring up trouble, and it seems certain they will continue until some manner of home rule is attained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1010020;The Irish Republican Brotherhood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1010020;Perhaps the time has come to examine the Irish situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010021;We’ve received reports that the Irish Republican Brotherhood has been active in $PROVINCENAME$, spreading propaganda and generally stirring up agitation against the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. The constabulary in $STATENAME$ has been actively hunting these nationalists down, but considering many within the constabulary are Irish themselves the process has not been simple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1010021;Fenians in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1010021;This is a serious issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010022;The Irish Republican Brotherhood has stirred up local resentment in $PROVINCENAME$, resulting in several riots and a renewed campaign against $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule in Ireland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1010022;Fenian Revolt in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1010022;This simply makes things far more difficult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010023;In an event organized by the Irish Republican Brotherhood, a group of Irish nationalists seized key locations in the city of $PROVINCENAME$ on Easter Monday, kicking off the most significant uprising in Ireland since the rebellion of 1798.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1010023;The Easter Rising;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1010023;This calls for decisive action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1010023;Due process must be followed, no matter the cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010024;Spurred on by increased public sympathy towards the Irish Republican Brotherhood following the Easter Rising, the Sinn Féin have won a majority of seats in Ireland during the last election. They have gathered in Dublin and declared themselves Dáil Éireann, the parliament of Ireland, and demanded that Ireland be granted immediate full independence. Considering their popularity, refusing would all but certainly trigger a war… but many agree that this is not the way to a peaceful resolution, and that $COUNTRY$ should never submit to such demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1010024;The Sinn Féin Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1010024;We will not be negotiated with at gunpoint.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1010024;Grant them independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010025;With Ireland once again under our control, talks have begun in earnest to deal with the Irish situation once and for all… now on our terms, rather than on theirs. The suggestion is that Ireland remain an autonomous Dominion under our control, with any regions that wish to opt out of the new state and remain part of $COUNTRY$ able to do so. Others suggest this is unworkable, and we should either simply release them and keep them as allies or annex them entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC1010030;An Anglo-Irish politician by the name of Charles Stewart Parnell has just been elected to Parliament. Some are describing him as a firebrand and nationalist agitator, while others suggest he’s a man of remarkable charisma and organizational talent-able to take on the entirety of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ political system in order to push his Irish Home Rule agenda and succeed. It’s very possible that this man could single-handedly turn the tide of opinion on the subject of Home Rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1010030;Charles Stewart Parnell;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1010030;Keep him contained. We don’t want trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1010030;Encourage him. He’ll do good work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010031;With Charles Stewart Parnell putting forward his Home Rule agenda, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens in $PROVINCENAME$ have become increasingly concerned that they might end up in an independent Irish state-one dominated by Irish Catholics in Dublin. They have begun actively campaigning to ensure this doesn’t happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1010031;The $STATENAME$ Volunteers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1010031;Yet more trouble in Ireland?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010032;Charles Stewart Parnell has been successfully advancing his Home Rule Bill through Parliament, and while it is continually being held up by opposition from the Upper House, there is a sense that the man is managing to convince $COUNTRY_ADJ$ law-makers who-in the not-too-distant past-might have said that Home Rule was unthinkable. \n \n Now we must consider whether his vision will see the light of day: do we grant Ireland the status of an autonomous Dominion under our control, or put this aside and face renewed violence among the Irish? Either way, this man Parnell will not desist, and the question will keep coming before us even if we do not pass the Bill now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1010032;Irish Home Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1010032;Pass the bill and give them Home Rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC1010032;Onward to Ireland! (Play as Ireland);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010033;The revelation that Charles Stewart Parnell has been involved with a married woman, one Catherine O’Shea, and indeed is responsible for her subsequent divorce, was the scandal that ended his political career and prevented him from pushing the Home Rule agenda. Without him, it appears unlikely that the Irish Republican movement will gain the political clout it requires to attempt another passing of the Home Rule Bill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1010033;Kitty O’Shea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1010033;Unfortunate. For the Irish, I mean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010034;Enclosure is the legal process of enclosing a number of small landholdings to create one larger farm. Once enclosed, use of the land became restricted to the owner, and it ceased to be common land for communal use. This results in less land for the people to cultivate. This, coupled with overpopulation in Ireland, contributed much to poverty in the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

As such, these devoted men of liberty wish to rename it to something more befitting of a democratic society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1645091;The Mandate of Heaven was a Chinese political and religious doctrine used to justify the rule of the emperor of China. According to this belief, heaven (tian)-which embodies the natural order and will of the universe-bestows the mandate on a just ruler, the Son of Heaven.\n \n If a ruler was overthrown, this was interpreted as an indication that the ruler was unworthy, and had lost the mandate. It was also a common belief that natural disasters such as famine and flood were signs of heaven’s displeasure with the ruler, so there would often be revolts following major disasters as citizens saw these as signs that the Mandate of Heaven had been withdrawn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC3886062;Brazil’s transition into a republic has not been as stable as some have hoped. There are frequent clashes in the streets between conservatives and liberals which end in large amount of bloodshed by both sides.

This might grant some stability, but it would be a betrayal to the ideas of democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4102182;Any question regarding the supremacy of South America has been answered by the thunderous sounds of South American boots marching through the Yankee capital. The great war is won, and the United States is over. Their reign of terror in the Caribbean and the Americas has finally come to an end. Latin America is in control of its own destiny, and the imperialist of the world quake in fear as the sons and daughters of Simon Bolivar stand strong in the New World.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC4413222;A recent effort has been made in New Africa to integrate the black and white population. Although there is a disagreement as to what extent integration should be attempted.

Although the most logical action would be to incorporate Alaska as a territory of the United States, some argue this would be imperialistic in nature and infringe upon the rights of population in Alaska. The majority Inuit population shows no interest in state building, and the small European Alaskan population is so small that it would not take long for American settlers to outnumber them.

EVTDESC7790010;The institution of a revolutionary regime in France in led most of the European monarchies to form coalitions against it. However, the military successes of the armies of the First Republic resulted in a considerable expansion of the national territory all the way to the left bank of the Rhine. While Napoleon Bonaparte would continue French conquests, His eventual defeat would lead France to be stripped of its new territory by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. The prospect of reclaiming France’s natural borders, however, remained popular to many people both within the government and France itself. Despite its cost in French blood and iron, we have finally reclaimed France’s Natural Borders.

EVTDESC7790011;In 1838 Jean François Langlois, commander of the whaling ship Cachalot, embarked on a grandiose scheme for a French colony at Akaroa. After a dubious land purchase from Maori he established the Nanto-Bordelaise Company in France to carry out the project, and in 1839, King Louis-Philippe agreed to provide assistance. The French representative for the settlement, Captain Charles François Lavaud, sailed for New Zealand in April 1840. A month later, the ship Comte de Paris set off for Akaroa carrying 53 emigrants. The French scheme sparked debate in England and France, and bowing to pressure to colonise the country, the British government sent out William Hobson in 1839. He signed the Treaty of Waitangi on 6 February 1840, and claimed sovereignty over the South Island on 17 June.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC7790100;With the Rhineland back under French control, the question has been raised as to what to do with the new ‘French’ subjects. Despite the German nature of the West Bank, The Rhinelanders had not been enemies of Revolutionary France, unlike the Spaniards or Portuguese. Prussia, even after their incorporation of the Rhineland and Westphalia in 1815, were regarded by the Rhinelanders with more suspicion, due to their Francophile feeling. The incorporation of such a large number of non-French citizens has also brought up France’s cultural diversity in other areas of the Empire, such as in Algeria or Flanders. Some of the more conservative politicians call for a purely French state, united in one language and culture. The Liberals, however, call for granting the Rhinelanders autonomy similar to that of the Walloons. While Autonomy will seriously hinder our assimilation efforts, it may reduce unrest in the Rhineland and prevent giving the Germans reason to intervene.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7859305;Chile has refused to join the Andes Republic on the principle of sovereignty and what not.

EVTDESC8629614;When the Confederate States of America achieved its independence from the United States, the country agreed to abide by the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves and to ban the transatlantic slave trade. Despite these agreements, some wealth slaveholders have recently been secretly importing slaves from Africa, believing them to be of superior stock as well as a prestigious addition to their plantation. While slavery is legal, the importation of slaves is not. Some fear international condemnation if the government does not take action to tighten enforcement against this growing trend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC8773762;Due to the size and power of Brazil, it was no surprise to many that it would unite the nations of South America under one flag. The Brazilian people have guided the continent to a new age of prosperity and liberty. With that being said, the majority of Spanish speaking population have always been uncomfortable hearing laws passed in the Portuguese tongue. The recent downturn in luck for our country has only exacerbated the issue. In Cusco, a congress of Spanish speaking delegates has gathered to demand greater autonomy. If we give in to such demands, our state will be weakened even further, yet to refuse would guarantee a civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

This includes forming “Greatest Germany” and assimilating the Dutch and one German group of your choosing (if conditions are met). It also adds a treaty organization (“Reichspakt”) mechanic. Furthermore, it also adds new stuff for other nations as well, some out of necessity, and others out of strive for more flavour.

Burgundy, once a province is now a nation. The Archduke of Guyenne, once a loyal vassal now pursues his own interests and the boards of the great trading companies of the east now serve no master aside from profits.

EVTDESC31500001;Similarly, to guberniyas of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland, the Baltic Governorates were not a subject to the common civil and administrative laws of the Russian Empire, but did not have monetary, fiscal and passport system of their own. Like guberniyas of the Kingdom of Poland they were treated as an integral entity and the Russian law provided them the preservation of local authorities. In the Baltics these were Landtags. The special legislation which set rules for municipal administration and entrepreneurship according to local traditions, as well as the privileges to the local nobility, usually German, in the Baltics was known under the collective name of Ostsee Right. Now that we are free from the Russians, the question remains about the future of our country and if it will remain united at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC44132189;The next step in the formation of the New African autonomous region is establishing its borders. There are three possibilities of varying sizes, each larger than the last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44132210;Our planning and funding have proven to be fruitful as a small slave revolt has erupted in $FROMCOUNTRY$. We should act quickly to intervene on behalf of New Africa in their fight for independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44132211;A small slave revolt has erupted in a province in the southern states. The insurgency is likely to spread to nearby plantations in neighbouring provinces, and we should act quickly to put down the uprising before it does too much damage to our economy. Furthermore, the Free States of America has officially recognized the burgeoning government formed by the rebellious slaves, and there exists the possibility that they might intervene.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44132212;Our planning and funding have proven to be fruitful as a massive slave revolt has erupted in $FROMCOUNTRY$. We should act quickly to intervene on behalf of New Africa in their fight for independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC44132214;The recent slave revolt has spread to $PROVINCENAME$. There are reports of roaming bands of slaves setting plantations aflame and massacring entire communities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44132215;We have received our supplies from the Free States of America. We will immediately begin distributing weapons and mobilizing our forces into a proper fighting force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC44132218;Several candidate cities would serve as suitable locations for the new capital of New Africa. Located in the along the Louisiana coast, New Orleans has long been the cultural capital of the country. Montgomery’s central location would make it an appropriate city for the capital to be seated, and its small size allows for some room to develop. Lastly, Atlanta is one of the largest cities in New Africa and is the economic heart of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44132219;In 1831, Nat Turner led a slave rebellion in Virginia that was composed of more than 70 slaves and resulted in the death of 60 white people, including women and children. After Nat Turner was captured and the rebellion ended, over a hundred slaves were massacred in retaliation. For many in New Africa, Nat Turner represents the heroism and determination needed to fight such a brutal system like slavery. However, whites in the country perceive Nat Turner as a violent murderer. With the 100th Anniversary of the rebellion closely approaching, there is mounting pressure on the government on how to remember such a cataclysmic event and such a complicated man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44132220;New Africa is currently experiencing a cultural renaissance emanating out of $CAPITAL$. Across the country, new works of literature are being published, new music genres are being defined, and new plays for the theatre are being written. Innovations are also occurring in the philosophical and academic fields leading to an explosion in fresh perspectives and new knowledge. Artists and intellectuals from across the world have taken notice of this reawakening of the New Africa spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44132223;Soon after its establishment, the New African government founded the National Underground Railroad Institute. While its official public function is to assist with the settlement of escaped slaves into New Africa, the Institute, as suggested by its less than subtle name, secretly works with abolitionists to help slaves escape bondage from the American South and flee to New Africa. There are also rumours that the Institute funds and organizes slave revolts;however, the Institute denies such accusations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44132224;With slavery no longer the menace it once was, The National Underground Railroad Institute no longer has a purpose and as such as has been officially closed. The headquarters of the Institute will be converted into a museum so future generations may learn of the courageous actions Institute conductors undertook in the name of liberty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44132225;New Africa is a nation of free people who once endured systematic violence and forced servitude. Now that the racial hierarchy of power has inverted, those that once sat at the top are resentful of their current low standing. As such, racial tensions are high in provinces that lack a black majority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44132226;Due to the lack of a black majority, $PROVINCENAME$ is experiencing significant racial tensions that will only subside as more African Americans and other accepted cultures settle in the area. This unrest will most likely spread throughout White majority provinces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44132227;As racial demographics shift in $PROVINCENAME$, once notable and disruptive racial tensions have faded into the background. Other provinces that have experienced similar population changes should also calm down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44132228;A man of both African and Indian heritage, John Horse fought alongside Seminole tribes against the United States Army during the Second Seminole War. He garnered a reputation as a skilled scout and talented negotiator, and Horse soon became a prominent leader among the Seminole people. After New Africa passed the Seminole Act, which integrated Indian tribes in Florida, John Horse offered his service and expertise to the army of New Africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44132229;In $YEAR$ onboard the brig Creole, Madison Washington, an enslaved cook, led his fellow slaves in a revolt against their captors who were transporting them to an American slave market. After killing the ship’s captain, they seized control of the vessel. Although they were initially planning to sail for Nassau, they have instead arrived at a New African port. The most apparent course of action is to welcome Washington and the other slaves as heroes. However, doing so will undoubtedly enrage the United States, which would accuse New Africa of harbouring criminals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44132230;Uncle Remus: His Songs and His Sayings is a collection of African American folktales that author Joel Chandler Harris recalled from his childhood on his family’s plantation in Georgia. Although New Africa has since liberated Georgia, many Southern whites, like Harris, still hold on dearly to their memories during the time of slavery, and as such, Harris’s book has quickly become a best-seller and favourite among the white community in New Africa. However, the character of Uncle Remus has received a very mixed reaction from black New Africans. While it is impossible to ignore the rich collection of folklore Harris has been able to compile, there are many, especially among the intellectual class, who are critical of what they believe to be a romanticizing of slavery and accuse Harris of cultural theft. The New African government can either curtail the distribution of Harris’s work or allow it circulate openly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44132231;Born into bondage in 1818, Fredrick Douglass escaped slavery at a young age and fled from Maryland to New Africa. He has quickly gained notoriety for his skill as an orator and controversy for his staunch support of racial and gender equality. While most in New Africa view him as the country’s most important statesman, few entirely embrace his radical proposal for the greater social and political integration of whites in New Africa. However, his most recent publication, A Narrative of New Africa, has enticed many New Africans into his Equality Party and led to an increased acceptance of the notion for greater equality among the races.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44132232;The legend of John Henry is the tale of one man with raw strength and incredible endurance beating a steam-powered machine in a competition to drill a tunnel through a mountain. Although where precisely this competition occurred and whether if such a man even existed is debatable, there is no denying that John Henry has become an inspiring symbol of the industrial New African man. Additionally, his hammer-wielding image has become closely associated with socialist parties and trade unions, especially those composed of railway workers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44132233;Prominent academic and founder of the Tuskegee Institute Booker T. Washington has always been known as a moderate voice in New African politics, and he frequently opposes war waged at the expense of various domestic reforms, especially those related to education. Washington recently gave a speech to a large crowd in $CAPITAL$. In the speech, he called for the development of greater respect and the reduction of tensions between whites and blacks in New Africa. Furthermore, Washington argued for better relations between New Africa and the United States and proposed a compromise in which New Africa would cease territorial expansion into the American South in return for an increase in trade and protection from the United States.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44132234;Before beginning to plan, we must decide how much money and supplies to devote to the revolt. The more funds we commit, the more likely of a large revolt erupting. If we only invest a small amount, then there is a lower chance of a successful revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC46610100;Ever since our declaration of independence, our borders with the neighbouring Brazilians have not been delineated through any treaty. The resident minister of Brazil in $COUNTRY$, Enéas Martins, is on a special mission in $CAPITAL$, to meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Alfredo Vásquez Cobo, to delineate a treaty to settle the border issue. The treaty would establish the border from the Rio Negro north-westward along the Amazon River-Orinoco watershed divide, then generally southward along various river courses and straight-line segments to the mouth of the Apaporis River. This would effectively mean the Marabitanas province will end up part of Brazil, though signing the treaty can positively affect our image internationally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Claimed by multiple countries and without a clear border demarcation, several incursions of foreigners from neighbouring countries searching for rubber sparked a few incidents and the de facto owner of the territory, $COUNTRY$, is now offering us monetary compensation, a friendship treaty as well as the possibility of funding a railway construction in our country in exchange for us dropping any claims we have over the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Five of the ship’s watertight compartments were breached. It soon became clear that the ship was doomed, as it could not survive more than four compartments being flooded. It began sinking bow-first, with water spilling from compartment to compartment as its angle in the water became steeper. Ships in $YEAR$ were seen as largely unsinkable and lifeboats were intended to transfer passengers to nearby rescue vessels so Titanic only had enough lifeboats to carry about half of those on board.

EVTOPTA152009874;A dark day for $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC152009875;Scattered gunfire can be heard echoing through the empty streets of London as the last pockets of resistance to the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ occupation are quelled. The parliament houses in the Palace of Westminster lay empty while $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers run up and down placing explosives in the silent corridors. A $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ general silently read the orders that came from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ capital with instructions to destroy the Palace in an attempt to crush the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ spirit. The explosives are detonated at the same time as the Clock Tower bell strike its precise hourly strike. The tower is engulfed by flames as parts of the western palace collapse, with pieces of the Big Ben landing on the Thames along with other debris while nearby buildings are hit by flaming debris and catch fire. $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers watch and cherish from a safe distance as the glass that once contained the phrase ‘DOMINE SALVAM FAC REGINAM NOSTRAM VICTORIAM PRIMAM’ rains on the ground. Nearby, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers storm the Buckingham Palace just to find out that the $MONARCHTITLE$ has already fled the country. They hoist the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ flag and turn to see the smoke rising in the horizon. London is lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC232000000;I saw, about four miles to the left, a sheet of water, which ultimately proved to be a creek and the southernmost part of what the Arabs call the Ukerewe Sea. Convinced that I finally found the source of the Nile, I went down a grassy and jungled depression into a deep, dirty, viscid nullah, which communicated with the southern end of the creek, which we named Jordan. As we followed the creek, that increased in breadth as it extended northwards, we saw many little islands in Ukerewe, well wooded, standing boldly out of the water. The journey continued through another tortuous day until we reached the village of Isamiro, where the view was clearer and better. In the distant horizon a calm sea line started to appear between north and west. Even in a well-known country the view would have attracted attention for its placid beauty, he thought to himself. He felt he had solved the great old riddle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC370000002;The factories extend their flanks of fouler brick one after another, bare, with shutter-less windows, like economical and colossal prisons… and inside, lit by gas-jets and deafened by the uproar of their own labour, toil thousands of workmen, penned in, regimented, hands active, feet motionless, all day and every day, mechanically serving their machines…’ \n The hard work that the city’s workers perform has outraged many, and a committee has been formed to tackle the rough working conditions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
