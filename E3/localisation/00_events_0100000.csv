EVTDESC110011;The English Anglo-Persian Oil Company was the first company to extract petroleum from $COUNTRY$. In 1901 William Knox D’Arcy negotiated an oil concession with Mozaffar al-Din: he would assume exclusive rights to prospect for 60 years in a vast tract of territory and in exchange the Shah received 20,000¤, an equal amount in shares, and a promise of future profits. In early May 1908 D’Arcy, having sunk more than 500,000¤ into his Persian venture and found no oil, sent a telegram saying that they had run out of money and ordering to ‘cease work, dismiss the staff, dismantle anything worth the cost and come home.’ The geologist George Bernard Reynolds delayed following these orders and in a stroke of luck, struck oil shortly after on May 26, 1908.

EVTDESC110020;On $YEAR$, the Shah granted foreigners a concession over the production, sale, and export of tobacco for fifty years. In exchange, they paid the Shah an annual sum plus a share of the profits. A Tobacco Régie (monopoly) was subsequently established and all the producers and owners of tobacco were forced to sell their goods to agents of the Régie, who would then resell the purchased tobacco. The concession represented a major blow to Persian farmers and bazaaris whose livelihoods were largely dependent on the lucrative tobacco business. Mass protests against the Régie began to emerge in major Iranian cities, spearheaded by the bazaari. The ulema proved to be a highly valuable ally of them as key religious leaders sought to defend traditional values and protect national interests from foreign domination. The brewing discontent threatens to rip our country apart, but giving in to their demands might have even more serious consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC110028;Bazaari is the name given to the merchants and workers of bazaars, the traditional marketplaces of Iran. Bazaaris differ from a social class as usually defined in that they include both rich wholesalers and bankers as well as lower-income workers. They are united not in their resistance to dependence on the West and the spread of Western ways, their traditionalist attitude and their close family, financial, and cultural ties with the Shia ulama or clerical class. Bazaari, led by its large merchants, in alliance with ulama clergy, have played an important part in recent Iranian history. The troubles have spread and the support of the nascent entrepreneur middle-class to our traditional elites could prove fatal to the economy and the social order.

EVTDESC110029;In 1864 until the early 20th century, another mass expulsion took place of Caucasian Muslims as a result of the Russian victory in the Caucasian War. These migrations once again, towards Iran, included masses of Azerbaijanis, other Transcaucasian and North Caucasian Muslims, such as Circassians, Shia Lezgins and Laks. Many of these migrants would prove to play a pivotal role in further Iranian history, as they formed most of the ranks of the Persian Cossack Brigade. Formed in 1879 in Persia. It was modelled after the Caucasian Cossack regiments of the Imperial Russian Army and, until 1920, it was commanded by Russian officers. Together with a Swedish trained and officered gendarmerie, the Cossack Brigade came to comprise the most effective military force available to the Iranian crown in the years prior to World War I and its most elite cavalry unit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC110050;Guided Democracy was the political system in place in Indonesia until the New Order began. It was the brainchild of President Sukarno, and was an attempt to bring about political stability. He believed that Western-style democracy was inappropriate for Indonesia’s situation. Instead, he sought a system based on the traditional village system of discussion and consensus, which occurred under the guidance of village elders. Sukarno proposed a threefold blend of nasionalisme (‘nationalism’), agama (‘religion’), and komunisme (‘communism’) into a co-operative ‘Nas-A-Kom’ government. This was intended to appease the three main factions in Indonesian politics-the army, Islamic groups, and the communists. With the support of the military, he proclaimed, ‘Guided Democracy’-western-style parliamentary democracy was thus finished in Indonesia until the Reformasi era.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC110053;Victorio was a fierce warrior and chief of the Warm Springs band of the Tchihendeh division of the central Apaches. For ten years, he and his band were moved to and left at least three different reservations, some more than once, despite his band’s request to live on traditional lands. Wandering around the US-Mexico border, they were successful at raiding and evading capture by the military and even won a significant engagement at Las Animas Canyon before allegedly leading the Alma Massacre. In $YEAR$, while moving along the Rio Grande in northern Mexico, Victorio and his band were surrounded and killed by soldiers of the Mexican Army in the Tres Castillos Mountains, in Chihuahua.

The first half was originally a serial in 1881 and 1882, and then later completed as a book for children in February 1883. It is about the mischievous adventures of an animated marionette named Pinocchio and his father; a poor woodcarver named Geppetto.

EVTDESC110056;The H. L. Hunley was one of the first submarine built by the CSA, but named and mostly financed after its main inventor, Horace Lawson Hunley. It played a small but symbolic part in the American Civil War by demonstrating the advantages and dangers of undersea warfare. She was the first combat submarine to actually sink a warship, which was an important step in the naval arms-race going on at the time: indeed, the Yankees had also developed their first submarine, the USS Alligator, while the Confederation had already lost two prototypes. Our advisors believe that may be what gives us the vital edge we were looking for, especially against blockades. Shall we support the project?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

But Dixon and a crew of seven volunteers successfully navigated the waters and aimed to reach the blockade. There, they spotted the USS Housatonic and began their approach. While the Yankees did see them, they were unable to fight back and the Hunley launched its torpedo swinging in the flank of the 1,260-ton vessel, sinking it in less than five minutes. The men then set for home and narrowly made it. Thus, the Hunley became the first submarine ship to successfully sink an enemy boat, marking History forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Why did you not take the opportunity of my coming to Kumasi to bring the Golden Stool for me to sit upon?’. Not understanding the significance of the stool, he clearly had no inkling of the storm his words would produce: the suggestion that he, a foreigner, should sit upon and defile the Golden Stool, the very embodiment of the Ashanti state, and very symbol of the Ashanti peoples, living, dead, and yet to be born, was far too insufferable for the crowd.

EVTDESC110074;Dom Pedro II, nicknamed ‘the Magnanimous’, was the second ruler of the young Empire of Brazil. Born in Rio de Janeiro, he was a member of the Brazilian branch of the House of Braganza. His father’s abrupt abdication and departure to Europe in order to restore his daughter on the throne of Portugal left a five-year-old Pedro II as Emperor and led to a grim and lonely childhood and adolescence. Still, he grew into a man with a strong sense of duty and devotion toward his country and his people-on the other hand, he was increasingly resentful of his role as monarch. Inheriting an Empire on the verge of disintegration, he turned it into an emerging power with an important economic growth, distinguished from its neighbours on account of its political stability. Still, despite its overwhelming popular support, Pedro II quickly became weary of emperorship and despaired over the monarchy’s future prospects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

One day in $YEAR$, while residing in Paris, he caught an infection that progressed quickly into pneumonia Pedro rapidly declined and died surrounded by his family. His last words were ‘May God grant me these last wishes-peace and prosperity for Brazil!’. While the body was being prepared, a sealed package in the room was found, and next to it a message written by the Emperor himself: ‘It is soil from my country, I wish it to be placed in my coffin in case I die away from my fatherland.’;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

This garnered the attention of the warlord in control of $COUNTRY$ and when he became too powerful to ignore, to deal with him without using force, he was named dajazmach of Qwara and married to the daughter of the warlord.

EVTDESC131712;British diplomats have approached the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, hoping to broker a peaceful arrangement between Tibet and $COUNTRY$ now that Tibet is independent. No doubt they intend to gain influence and territory in Tibet, as well as an ally against $COUNTRY_ADJ$ aggression, but the prospect of war should the negotiations fail seems likely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC131713;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have agreed to the arrangements made at the Simla Convention, and our relations with them have improved as a result-not to mention our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME131713;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA131713;We are pleased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC131715;Our efforts to modernize the Beiyang army have borne fruit, but this has necessitated the division of authority among regional forces. The generals in charge of these forces, ‘warlords’ as some call them, have been gaining a great deal of power. They are part of the Beiyang Army, but fight amongst themselves… And, far worse, are critical of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. We will need to watch these generals carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME131715;The New Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA131715;They will serve $COUNTRY$. Or else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC131720;Warlord influence has begun to spread into $STATENAME$. These generals are still loyal to $COUNTRY$, but it is becoming increasingly apparent that they are taking control of a significant portion of the country. Officials in $CAPITAL$ are alarmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME131720;Spread of Anhui Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA131720;This is becoming worrisome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME131721;Spread of Guangdong Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME131722;Spread of Guangxi Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME131723;Spread of Hunan Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME131724;Spread of Fengtian Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME131725;Spread of Ma Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME131728;Spread of Sichuan Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME131729;Spread of Xinjiang Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC131730;Resistance against the $CAPITAL$ government has culminated in a breakdown in authority. What began with several of the outlying warlords declaring their independence has ended with the most powerful generals in the Beiyang Army struggling for control. A contest has begun regarding who will control the future of China’s destiny, and most are certain it will not be long before the entire nation is engulfed in war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME131730;The Warlord Era;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA131730;$COUNTRY$ shall be restored!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC131735;Now that we are free, we must choose where we stand in the ensuing struggle for the nation’s destiny: either side with the Kuomintang and fight for domination of the republic or side with the Beiyang and fight for domination of a united China. Alternatively, we can declare our neutrality in the conflict and let the chips fall where they may.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME131735;The Struggle for China;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA131735;We will side with the Kuomintang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB131735;We will side with the Beiyang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC131735;We will remain neutral.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC131736;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ general by the name of Feng Yuxiang has betrayed his superiors and broken off from the Beiyang armies. He and his supporters have taken the territory under their control and formed a new clique, swearing to topple the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME131736;The Guominjun Clique;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA131736;We will fight for Communist China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA131737;The Beiyang must fight for the greater glory of China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA131739;He shall pay for this betrayal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC131740;The leaders of the Kuomintang are preparing for their drive on Beijing, and $COUNTRY$ is expected to answer the call. Either we side with Nationalist China now, or we must abandon the Kuomintang cause and seek our own destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME131740;Leader of the Kuomintang;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA131740;Join the forces of Nationalist China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB131740;Abandon the Kuomintang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC131741;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has answered the call, and will unite their forces with ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME131741;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Joins the Kuomintang;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA131741;Together we shall triumph!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC131742;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are crying out for the nation to once again unify. We must gather our strength and strike out at those who would divide China, leaving it weak for foreigners to prey upon. Already the banners are in the streets, and $COUNTRY$’s generals are saying now is the time to launch an offensive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME131742;The War of Reunification;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA131742;For the good of all China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB131742;Now is not the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC131743;We have received reports that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ army is massing on our mutual border, ready to make a massive offensive into $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory. It seems a war is upon us, whether we like it or not: either they destroy us or we destroy them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME131743;War with $FROMCOUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC131745;The call has come from the capital: the era of warlords is over, and all the Chinese peoples must unite under a single flag. This means $COUNTRY$ must either submit to Beijing’s rule or face more war against a strong and unified foe. Your generals stand ready to receive your command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME131745;Chinese Reunification;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA131745;$COUNTRY$ shall submit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB131745;We accept Beijing’s rule but will maintain our independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC131745;$COUNTRY$ shall never surrender!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC131746;Now that we own the island of Formosa, the local Min population has begun to organize itself-presumably towards the end of breaking away from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME131746;The Island of Formosa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA131746;Good luck with that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
