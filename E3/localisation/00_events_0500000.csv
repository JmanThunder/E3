EVTDESC500000;The Organic Statute of the Kingdom of Poland was a Statute which replaced the Constitution of 1815 in the aftermath of the failed November Uprising in the Russian Partition. The Statute was pronounced in occupied Warsaw on March 1832 by Marshal Ivan Fyodorovich Paskevich, who named himself a namestnik. The Statute, signed by Emperor Nicholas I of Russia, replaced the personal union between the Kingdom of Poland and the Russian Empire with the ‘eternal incorporation’ of Poland into Russia. The Parliament of the Kingdom was abolished, and its army merged with the Russian Army. \n §RNOTE: Congress Poland is an extremely hard to play substate. You won’t get any soldiers and when the Polish Uprising begins you will probably lose the game.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC500001;After the latest war our subjects in Poland and other parts of our empire began to grow restless. The uprising began as a spontaneous protest by young Poles against conscription into the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Army. It was soon joined by high-ranking Polish-Lithuanian officers and various politicians. In Warsaw alone 116 demonstrations were held in $YEAR$. Much of these manifestations in ended in clashes with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Army. In spite of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ police interference, a symbolic meeting of hymn-singing Poles and Lithuanians took place on the bridge across an important River. The crowds sang ‘God protect Poland’ in Lithuanian and Belarusian. Earlier in $YEAR$ the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government introduced a state of emergency in Kovno and Grodno as well as several other Polish-majority provinces.

Van Doren, Oil Merchant and Stearin Candle Manufacturer, known as a seller of whale oil, at 34 New Street in Manhattan, and spread quickly to adjoining buildings. During the ten and a half hours that it burned, the fire killed 4 Firefighters and 26 civilians and in total destroyed 345 buildings, resulting in property damage estimated between 5 and 10 million dollars. \n \n The fire would be the last of three devastating fires that affected the city, the other two occurring in 1776 & 1835. While very destructive, the $YEAR$ fire confirmed the value of building codes restricting wood-frame construction, which were put in place after the lessons learnt from the previous fires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

More than two thirds of the structures in Chicago at the time of the fire were made entirely of wood, with most of the houses and buildings being topped with highly flammable tar or shingle roofs. \n \n The fire destroyed an area about 4 miles long, encompassing an area of more than 2,000 acres, leaving 300 dead and over a 100,000 of Chicago’s residents homeless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Christopher Columbus’ first voyage to the Americas landed at the site of what is now Môle-Saint-Nicolas on December 6, 1492.

EVTDESC530011;From his flag ship, the Philadelphia, Rear-Admiral Gherardi addressed his demand for Môle Saint-Nicolas to the Haitian Government. Gherardi was in so great a hurry to win that which he imagined would be an easy success, that he did not think it necessary to secure the cooperation of Mr. Frederick Douglass, who was at that time United States Minister at Port-au-Prince—he alone signed the letter. Mr. A. Firmin, then Haitian Secretary of State, availed himself at once of this blunder to request the credentials of the Rear-Admiral, who, not being provided with any, was obliged to write to Washington for them.\n \n By the time President Harrison’s letter appointing Gherardi his special Commissioner reached Port-au-Prince, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ squadron had long been in Haiti’s waters. The array of force had been counterproductive, provoking loud public protest against the $COUNTRY_ADJ$s. Under these circumstances, Haiti was compelled to stand firm against the $COUNTRY_ADJ$s. Firmin refused the deal on the grounds that the Constitution of Haiti forbade alienation of any portion of the nation’s territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC600000;The February Revolution of 1917 was the first of two revolutions in Russia in 1917. Centred on the then capital Petrograd (modern day St. Petersburg) in March (late February in the Julian calendar). This revolution appeared to break out spontaneously, without any real leadership or formal planning. Russia had been suffering from a number of economic and social problems, which were compounded by the impact of World War I. Bread rioters and industrial strikers were joined on the streets by disaffected soldiers from the city’s garrison. As more and more troops deserted, and with loyal troops away at the Front, the city fell into a state of chaos, leading…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600001;Lenin arrived in Petrograd on April 16, 1917, one month after the Tsar had been forced to abdicate. On his return to Russia, Lenin electrified his own comrades, most of whom accepted the authority of the Provisional Government. Lenin called this government, despite its democratic pretensions, thoroughly imperialist and undeserving of support by Socialists. It was incapable of satisfying the most profound desires of the workers, soldiers, and peasants for immediate peace and division of landed estates among the peasants. Only a soviet government-that is, direct rule by workers, soldiers, and peasants-could fulfil these demands. Therefore, he raised the battle cry, ‘All power to the Soviets!’. He began publishing papers and stirring up the communists and socialists! What should the provisional government do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600002;The Milyukov note was an incident on the 20th of April 1917, one which resulted in the bolstering of support for the Bolsheviks in Russia, and a widespread mistrust of the Russian Provisional Government. Foreign Minister Pavel Milyukov sent the Allied Powers a telegram, one which would prove to be a turning point of 1917. The telegram contained the statement that the Provisional Government would continue the war with the Tsarist war aims. The telegram was leaked to the Bolsheviks by an insider, and they began protests against the Provisional Government, which had previously promised the people that the terror of Tsardom had ended. The consequences were…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600003;The July Days refers to events in 1917 that took place in Petrograd, Russia, between 3 July and 7 July (Julian calendar), when soldiers and industrial workers engaged in spontaneous demonstrations against the Russian Provisional Government. The Bolsheviks tried to provide leadership to the demonstrations. The military attacked the peaceful demonstration and engaged in repression against the Bolsheviks. Lenin went into hiding, while other leaders were arrested. The outcome of the July Days represented a temporary decline in the growth of Bolshevik power and influence in the period before the October Revolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600004;The Kornilov Affair, was an (alleged) attempted coup d’état by the then Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Army, General Lavr Kornilov, in August 1917 against the Russian Provisional Government headed by Alexander Kerensky. Kerensky, hearing of a possible coup attempt by Kornilov, questioned him and interpreted his responses as a confirmation of his intention to seize power by force. In response, Kerensky dismissed Kornilov from his position. When the telegram to dismiss Kornilov arrived, he believed that Kerensky was acting under intense pressure from the Soviets and consequently the Bolsheviks, therefore he ordered the Third Cavalry Corps to move swiftly to Petrograd to put down what he assumed to be a Bolshevik uprising. The coup failed and Kornilov was incarcerated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600005;The October Revolution of 1917 was led by the Bolsheviks, specifically by Lenin, who used their influence in the Petrograd Soviet to organize the armed forces. Bolshevik Red Guards forces under the Military Revolutionary Committee began the takeover of government buildings on 24 October 1917 (O.S.). The following day, the Winter Palace (the seat of the Provisional government located in Petrograd, then capital of Russia), was captured. The October revolution ended the phase of the revolution instigated in February, replacing Russia’s short-lived provisional parliamentary government with government by soviets, local councils elected by bodies of workers and peasants. Liberal and monarchist forces, loosely organized into the White Army, immediately went to war against the Bolsheviks Red Army, in a series of battles that would become known as the Russian Civil War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600006;The Communists have finally fallen out of power in the motherland. The ‘Soviet Union’ no longer exists. Only Russia, one and indivisible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600007;We are no longer only Russia, but rather the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics! Russia no longer exists, so neither should its claims on our country!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600008;The Russian Civil War (25 October 1917—October 1922) was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire fought between the Bolshevik Red Army and the White Army, the loosely allied anti-Bolshevik forces. Many foreign armies warred against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies. The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919. The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in the Crimea and were evacuated in the autumn of 1920. A number of independent countries—Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland—emerged from the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600009;The civil war has finally ended. The Russian economy was devastated by the war, with factories and bridges destroyed, cattle and raw materials pillaged, mines flooded, and machines damaged. The industrial production value descended to one seventh of the value of 1913, and agriculture to one third. War Communism saved the Soviet government during the Civil War, but much of the Russian economy had ground to a standstill. But now our motherland can finally rebuild itself, in peace, free of the capitalism oppression.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC600015;It has been a long, harsh revolution.

Now that the country has calmed down, we can begin reforming our government properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC600018;The Third International or The Communist International, was an association of national communist parties founded in 1919 by Lenin. Though its stated purpose was the promotion of world revolution, the Comintern functioned chiefly as an organ of Soviet control over the international communist movement. The Comintern emerged from the three-way split in the socialist Second International. A majority of socialist parties, comprising the International’s ‘right’ wing, chose to support the war efforts of their respective national governments against exterior enemies. The ‘centre’ faction of the International decried the nationalism of the right and sought the reunification of the Second International under the banner of world peace. The ‘left’ group, led by Vladimir Lenin, rejected both nationalism and pacifism, urging instead a socialist drive to transform the war of nations into a transnational class war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600019;In November 1917, following the October Revolution, the first government of the independent Transcaucasia was created in Tbilisi. The Transcaucasian Commissariat (Sejm) existed for a couple of months following the Bolshevik seizure of power. Later, the Sejm proclaimed the ‘Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic’ and a peace conference was held between the Ottoman Empire and a delegation of the Sejm. The mood prevailing in Tbilisi was very different. Tbilisi acknowledged a state of war between itself and the Ottoman Empire. A new peace conference opened at Batum and at this conference the Ottomans extended their demands. The Armenian and Georgian members of the Republic’s delegation began to stall. Beginning on May 21, the Ottoman army moved ahead once again. The conflict led to a series of battles and on May 26, 1918, Georgia declared independence;two days later, Armenia and Azerbaijan followed suit, dissolving the federation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600020;With the Bolshevik taking the power in Russia, they are pressuring us to change our government to be more aligned with theirs! They demand a proletariat government in our country! What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600021;The October Revolution of 1917 turned Finnish politics upside down. Now, the new non-Socialist majority of the Parliament desired total independence, and the Socialists came gradually to view Soviet Russia as an example to follow. On November 15, 1917, the Bolsheviks declared a general right of self-determination, including the right of complete secession, ‘for the Peoples of Russia’. On the same day the Finnish Parliament issued a declaration by which it temporarily took power in Finland. Worried by the development in Russia, and Finland, the non-Socialist Senate proposed that Parliament declare Finland’s independence, which was agreed on in the Parliament on December 6, 1917. On December 18 the Soviet government issued a Decree, recognizing Finland’s independence, and on December 22 it was approved by the highest Soviet executive body—VTsIK. Germany and the Scandinavian countries followed without delay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600022;Historically, with the outbreak of the World War I, the Russian Empire fell into revolution and civil war. As a part of this larger conflict, the Estonians declared independence from Russia and won their freedom during the Estonian War of Independence. As a symbol of Estonian independence, Yuryev/Dorpat was officially given back its Estonian name, Tartu. The new Communist Russian government acknowledged Estonia’s freedom in the 1920 Treaty of Tartu. The Estonians are offering us a peace treaty, what should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600023;Historically, after the Russian Empire lost the Crimean war and was weakened economically and politically, an unrest started in the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In Vilnius alone 116 demonstrations were held in 1861. In August 1861, manifestations in Vilnius ended in clashes with the Imperial Russian Army. In spite of Russian police and Cossack interference, a symbolic meeting of hymn-singing Poles and Lithuanians took place on the bridge across Niemen River. After a series of patriotic riots, the Russian Namestnik of Tsar Alexander II, General Karl Lambert, introduced martial law in Poland on 14 October 1861. Public gatherings were banned and some public leaders made outlaws. Now, with the hardships of the Crimean War, the poles, the Lithuanians and the Ukrainians are rising to make patriotic demonstrations. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600024;The January Uprising was an uprising in the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (present-day Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Latvia, parts of Ukraine, western Russia) against the Russian Empire. It began on 22 January 1863 and lasted until the last insurgents were captured in 1865. The uprising began as a spontaneous protest by young Poles against conscription into the Imperial Russian Army, and was soon joined by high-ranking Polish-Lithuanian officers and various politicians.

Most of the uprising was limited to the Free City of Kraków, where Jagiellonian University philosophy professor Michal Wiszniewski acted as its chief for a day, to be followed by Rector Jan Tyssowski. Teofil Wisniowski, the President of the Uprising Tribunal in the Austrian province of Galizien, led a short-lived uprising in Eastern Galicia, which saw a battle at Narajów involving Austrian hussars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC600059;The political scene in Uruguay during the 1830s became split between two parties, the conservative Blancos (‘Whites’) and the liberal Colorados (literally ‘coloureds’, more usually ‘Reds’). The Colorados were led by Fructuoso Rivera and represented the business interests of Montevideo. The Blancos were headed by Manuel Oribe, who looked after the agricultural interests of the countryside and promoted protectionism. The two groups took their names from the colour of the armbands that they wore. Initially, the Colorados wore blue, but when it faded in the sun, they replaced it with red. \n \n The Uruguayan Constitution of 1830 didn’t anticipate the sharing of political power between parties, which forced the minorities to resort to revolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA600059;Troublemakers, the lot of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600060;With the destruction of our army, Oribe took the opportunity to seize the countryside. Now, they are moving in to take the capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA600060;That can’t end well for us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB600061;Let it go, Rosas surely will not interfere in Uruguay anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600062;For a long time, two projects of country divided Argentina. Unitarianists or Unitarians were the proponents of the concept of a Unitary state (centralized government) in Buenos Aires and they were led by Juan Lavalle. They were opposed to the Argentine Federalists, who wanted a federation of independent provinces, led by Juan Manuel de Rosas. The Unitarians, sympathetic to our government, fled Argentina in exile after being defeated in 1831. Rosas, the so-called Restorer of the Laws, controlled the Argentine Confederation for too long under his despotic rule. Now, our friends in Uruguay defeated the Blancos and promise to support us if we were to fight the Federalists to end Rosas despotic ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME600062;The Argentine Federalists;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA600062;Tell them we are ready for war when they are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600063;Genaro Berón de Astrada, governor of Corrientes, pledged to support us in our struggle against Rosas. The moment has arrived to rid the world of the tyrant. If we back down now, our government might look weak. France and the United Kingdom, that long had an attrition with Rosas, will surely help us in our struggle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME600063;The Big War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA600063;Call the Caudillos. Mobilize the troops. Rosas will fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC600064;The Uruguayan President backed down from the war with Rosas, but Rosas knows of the plan. This, combined with previous attrition with him, will surely lead to a war against him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA600064;Fight to the last man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB600064;It’s time to step down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600065;Rivera, the Uruguayan president, convinced governor Genaro Berón de Astrada to support him and Corrientes in a rebellion against Buenos Aires. Uruguay is preparing for war against us and they seek to depose Rosas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA600065;The fools!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600066;Giuseppe Garibaldi moved in with his wife and has been living in Montevideo for a time already. A sworn fighter against tyranny, he now has offered his help in setting up the defences of Montevideo against Oribe and Rosas and has offered to lead an Italian Legion made of foreign soldiers that will help us in the struggle against the tyranny of Rosas. Furthermore, it has been recommended that we do as the Blancos are planning to do and abolish slavery in Uruguay so we can have more soldiers for the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME600066;The Italian Legion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA600066;We welcome him and his soldiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB600066;We don’t need any help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA600069;Finally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600070;The war with Argentina and the Blancos costed too much already and our people want peace, internally and externally. The Brazilians are showing some interest in the conflict, and our country, and they would help us much in the struggle against Rosas and Oribe. Our diplomats began the talks and the conditions the Brazilians are asking are the free navigation of the Uruguay river, taxes and trade benefits, renouncement of our claims on the border with Rio Grande do Sul and the recognition of Brazil’s right to interfere with our internal affairs. \n \n Getting Brazilian help would undoubtedly tip the war in our favour and it is better than to risk another Blanco government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME600070;Brazilian Intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA600070;I’m sure there will be no problems. Ask for their help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB600070;We can take care of this war by ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600071;For a long time, Uruguay has been plunged into turmoil. It fights the Blancos, which aren’t too fond of us, and the Argentine, which aren’t too fond of us either. But the war isn’t going very well for them, and they are asking for our help. In exchange for our help, they are proposing several benefits for our country, such as treaties for the free navigation of the Uruguay river, taxes and trade benefits, renouncement of their claims on the border with Rio Grande do Sul and the recognition of Brazil’s right to interfere with Uruguay internal affairs. This would undoubtedly bring our countries close together and can serve as the start of Brazilian hegemony in the south of the continent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME600071;Uruguay asks for our help;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA600071;Agree to these terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB600071;We can’t afford to help them right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600072;After years of struggle for power, both the Colorados and the Blancos were weary of the chaos. In $YEAR$, they came to an agreement to define spheres of influence: the Colorados would control Montevideo and the coastal region, the Blancos would rule the hinterland with its agricultural estates. In addition, the Blancos were paid a lump sum of money to compensate them for the loss of their stake in Montevideo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME600072;Spheres of Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA600072;Finally, we can have some peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB600072;Unnecessary. Our current government will always have power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600073;Blancos and Colorados finally learned to share political power. This will severely reduce rebellion and aggressions between the parties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD600074;Don’t interfere in Uruguay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC600075;Rosas is defeated and fled Argentina to the United Kingdom. Oribe lost all claims on the presidency and also fled the country, but that will not stop trouble with the Blanco party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC696969;The Reichspakt is a complicated system of invitations into an economic union between you and another nation. This union is fragile and can be dissolved if your relations fall below a certain threshold. Moreover, each country will give you a selection of modifiers, though each weak on their own, will add up. In order to invite new members, you will need to have relations of at least 180 between your two nations.\n It should be noted that while you have no limit on invites, each additional member will make it harder to invite new ones, as your diplomatic and influence points are reduced based on the country invited. Lastly, if war breaks out between you and an invited member, they will get an event that will end the war, but with a cut in relations. This will allow them to get an event to leave the pact, and thus making them able to declare war on you again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC700000;Paraguayan supreme dictator, José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, took several precautions against assassination. He would lock the Palace doors himself, unroll the cigars his sister made to ensure there was no poison, prepare his own yerba mate, and sleep with a pistol under his pillow. No one could come within six paces of him, or even bear a cane near him. Whenever he would go out riding, he had all bushes and trees along the route uprooted so that assassins could not hide. All shutters had to be closed, and pedestrians had to prostrate before him as he passed. Sensing his mortality, he destroyed all his papers and refused medical aid, even lashing out at a physician with his sabre. In this day, Francia breathed his last and passed away. Francia left the state treasury with at least twice as much money in it as when he took office, including 36,500 pesos of his unspent salary, the equivalent of several years’ salary. His daughter later burnt all his furniture after his death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

A few months later, Congress changed his post from consul to president, and elected him to the new post for a 10-year term. The constitution not only legally sanctioned López’ dictatorial powers, but included no guarantees of civil rights. Indeed, the word ‘liberty’ was not even mentioned in the text.\n His government now is directing energy towards developing the material resources and strengthening the military power of the country. One of his first actions was to strengthen Paraguay’s grip on the Chaco region by building forts and founding villages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In 1853, he refused to ratify a commercial and navigational treaty with the United States and began confiscating the property of American citizens residing in Paraguay.

Although he strived for equality of the people, Francia ruthlessly destroyed any opposition and created a Police state, imprisoning all those he deemed seditious. \n Francia lived a spartan lifestyle, and apart from some books and furniture, his only possessions were a tobacco case and a pewter confectionery box.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

He also became infatuated with the empire of Napoleon III and with Napoleon Bonaparte himself. López equipped his army with exact copies of uniforms of Napoleonic army.

EVTOPTD800000;We should waste no time! ATTACK!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC800012;We have been secretly approached by certain members within the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government, suggesting that $COUNTRY_ADJ$ intervention to free them from foreign control might be in both our interests. $FROMCOUNTRY$ would be free to seek its own destiny, while $COUNTRY$ would gain an ally. The catch, of course, is that the attempt could look like interference to the rest of the world… and earn us the enmity of $FROMCOUNTRY$’s rulers in particular. If we make the attempt, we should learn of the results within a week at the most.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME800012;Intervention in $FROMCOUNTRY$?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA800015;Too bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC800016;$FROMCOUNTRY$ attempted to intervene, but the resulting orgy of violence in $CAPITAL$ has failed to drive out the influence of our overlord.

EVTOPTA800016;We shall see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC800017;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has supported the could d’état in $CAPITAL$, but with the change came an orgy of violence that has seen $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in $COUNTRY$ damaged along with that of our overlord.

EVTDESC800021;A foreign power attempted to use their influence in $FROMCOUNTRY$ to take advantage of the unrest there and free them from our control.

EVTDESC810003;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats along with representatives from the other Great Powers have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to discuss the question of the Danish straits and, more specifically, the Sound Dues. Citing the fact that the world’s seafaring nations are becoming less and less tolerant of these tolls and restrictions, they are lobbying for the abolition of the Dues and for the commitment that all Danish straits will be turned into international waterways free to all military and commercial shipping. In compensation for the abolition, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state will receive a one-time fee of 300,000¤. Though the convention is amicable, the Great Powers made clear that they are prepared to use force to open the straits, if it comes to that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC810004;In $YEAR$, after several days of harsh negotiations, the Great Powers of the world signed a treaty in the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ capital decreeing the abolition of all tolls in the Danish straits, turning them into international waterways free to all military and commercial shipping. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is to be compensated with a sum of 300,000¤. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ is acting as the guarantor, paying at least one third of the total sum while two other European Great Powers with stakes on the negotiations will be asked to pay the remaining two-thirds. After more than four centuries of tolls, the Danish straits are now free for commerce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC810005;$FROMCOUNTRY$ called for a convention over the use of the Danish straits and we, as one of the Great Powers of the world, were obliged to attend. After a positive resolution, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats are now trying to gather the remaining money to pay for the deal and they argue that our ships and our commerce in general stand posed to greatly benefit from the opening of the Danish straits. Based on this they argue that we should contribute to the indemnifications owed to the Danish straits’ controller. We are, of course, not bound by this—we can refuse, but doing so would not only hurt our image in the eyes of other countries, it would also anger $FROMCOUNTRY$: they would feel that we are indebted to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC810006;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government refused to do their part and help in the payment of the indemnifications over the opening of the Sound Toll. As the guarantor we are expected to convince them—or cover the costs and collect the money later from the $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC900022;A twenty-four years old merchant from Shiraz, called Siyyid ‘Alí Muhammad Shírází, on May 22, 1844, claimed to be an inspired interpreter of the Qur’an within the Shaykhi school of Twelver Shi’ism. Within five months, eighteen disciples of the Skaykhi school had independently recognized him as a Manifestation of God. These eighteen disciples were later known as the Letters of the Living. In his early writings, Siyyid appears to identify himself as the gate (báb) to the Hidden Twelfth Imam and later he begins to explicitly proclaim his station as that of the Hidden Imam and a new messenger from God. After some time, preaching by the Letters of the Living led to opposition by the Islamic clergy, prompting the Governor of Shiraz to order the Báb’s arrest. The Báb, upon hearing of the arrest order, left Bushehr for Shiraz in $YEAR$ and presented himself to the authorities.

The night before his execution, a young Bábí called Anís threw himself at the feet of the Báb and begged to be killed with him. Both were taken to the courtyard of the barracks the next day where thousands of people had gathered to watch the execution. They were suspended on a wall in front of a large squad of Christian soldiers, the order was given to fire and the courtyard was filled with musket smoke. When it cleared, the Báb was no longer in the courtyard and Anís was unharmed: the bullets apparently had not harmed either man, but had cut the ropes. There was a great commotion, many in the crowd believing the Báb had ascended to heaven or simply disappeared.

EVTDESC952513;With the end of the German Confederation as a customs union and the rise of a modern, unified German state, the Duchy of Limburg became an outdated promise.

Our claim in the region is tenuous, but it exists and we could push for it.

In $YEAR$, thanks to the successful lobbying of businessman Henry Shelton Sanford at the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$ request, the United States decided that the cessions claimed by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$ from the local leaders were lawful and recognized the International Association of the Congo’s claim on the region, becoming the first country to do so. The Congo Conference officially recognized the International Congo Association and specified that it should have no connection with $COUNTRY$ or any other country, but would be under the personal control of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC955184;During the Congo Conference, a 14-nation conference convened to submit the Congo question to international control and to finalize the colonial partitioning of the African continent. Most major powers attended the Congo Conference, and drafted an international code governing the way that European countries should behave as they acquired African territory. The conference, however, failed to recognize the International Association of the Congo’s claims to the Congo and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ bids of humanitarian aid and philanthropic work fell to the pressures of economic interests and imperialism. The Great Powers of the world now scramble to, under the principle of effective occupation, acquire control over the Congo regions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME955184;The Congo Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA955184;We urge them to reconsider.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC955185;The Great Powers of the world, meeting during the Congo Conference, awarded the Congo to the International Association of the Congo, controlled by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ ruler. They now demand that all of the agreed territory be passed on to the philanthropic organization, which includes some territory we currently control. Disobeying the will of the Conference might attract the anger of the Great Powers, while abiding for their will might leave us in their good graces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA955185;We will abide to their deliberation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB955185;They will have to take it from us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC955186;With the Berlin Conference coming to an end and the great powers moving in Africa according to the principle of effective occupation, the creation of the Congo Free State became a reality and the $MONARCHTITLE$’s dominance over it was internationally recognized. The $MONARCHTITLE$ pledged to suppress the East African slave trade, promote humanitarian policies, guarantee free trade within the colony, impose no import duties for twenty years and to encourage philanthropic and scientific enterprises. Beginning in $YEAR$, however, the $MONARCHTITLE$ began to issue a series of decrees that violated these conditions. It was first decreed that the State asserted rights of proprietorship over all vacant lands throughout the Congo. Afterwards, the rights of the Congolese were reduced in their land to native villages and farms, making nearly all of the CFS crown lands. We can continue these policies which will lead to an eventual annexation, revert them or simply take control of the CFS, dealing with the consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME955186;The Congo’s Destiny;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA955186;The Congo will be ruled as the $MONARCHTITLE$’s private property for our benefit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTE955186;Onwards to Bakongo’s Congo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC955187;As the Congo is the private property of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$, we need to decide every three years how the country will be run for the next three years. Being too lenient and using it solely for philanthropic work might cement the country’s destiny as a civilizing experiment, forever barring it from being a colony. Pushing the natives to meet the production quotas, on the other hand, might lead to abuse that can give our opposition and the humanitarian organizations some ammunition against us. While that will not hinder any plans of colonizing the Congo, it will certainly affect our reputation in the eyes of the world. The optimal solution would be maintaining balance for long enough that the philanthropic excuse doesn’t collapse at the same time that our imperialistic plans for the Congo slowly become recognized and legitimized. Unfortunately for that, running the Congo is a costly affair and can easily leave us with debt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME955187;Statesmanship in the Congo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA955187;The Congolese WILL meet their production quotas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB955187;We don’t need to push them too hard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC955187;A little philanthropic work never hurt anybody.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC955188;The baskets of severed hands, set down at the feet of the European post commanders, became the symbol of the Congo Free State. The collection of hands became an end in itself. Soldiers brought them to the stations in place of rubber, they even went out to harvest them instead of rubber… They became a sort of currency. They came to be used to make up for shortfalls in rubber quotas, to replace… the people who were demanded for the forced labour gangs, and the soldiers were paid their bonuses on the basis of how many hands they collected.’ The mass-deaths in the CFS became a cause célèbre in $YEAR$. The Congo reform movement led a vigorous international movement against the maltreatment of the Congolese population. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$ offered to reform his regime, but international opinion supported an end to the $MONARCHTITLE$’s rule and finally, yielding to international pressure, the Upper House of $COUNTRY$ annexed the Congo Free State in $YEAR$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC955189;In direct violation of his promises of free trade within the CFS under the terms of the Congo Treaty, not only had the State become a commercial entity directly or indirectly trading within its dominion, but also the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$ had been slowly monopolizing a considerable amount of the ivory and rubber trade by imposing export duties on the resources traded by other merchants within the CFS. Despite all that, improvements in the Congo had been made and there was no over exploitation of the natives. Running the risk of corporations causing a humanitarian disaster because of over exploitation, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ upper house decided, in a move coordinated and approved by other Great Power, to remove the $MONARCHTITLE$ as the sole personal ruler of the Congo and put it under control of $COUNTRY$ with all the legal institutions and guarantees that came with it. The corporations and the $MONARCHTITLE$ will be thoroughly compensated for the change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA955189;A new era begins for the Congo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

He drove the slavers from the Congo basin, helped the natives modernize and civilize, he kept the Congo open for trade with all the nations. A few abuses were reported here and there, but this was usually passed as corruption or power abuse. The $MONARCHTITLE$ was never involved or held liable for those. This situation, however, led to the Great Powers closely watching the Congo and an international recognition of the Congo right to exist. This means that colonizing the Congo is a path that we can no longer trail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

There are several bills in the Upper House about its destiny, from annexation as a colony to letting them be free.

It sent to Eyre first, and he enclosed a letter with his own comments.\n \n The Queen’s reply was made known, and many of the poor believed that Eyre had influenced her opinion: she encouraged the poor to work harder, rather than offering any help.

EVTDESC999700;The Christian Cretans had risen up together with the rest of Greece in the Greek Revolution of 1821, but despite successes in the countryside, the Ottomans held out in the four fortified towns of the northern coast and the island was eventually reconquered by 1828, becoming an Egyptian province. Another uprising later secured some privileges, such as the right to bear arms, equality of Christian and Muslim worship, and the establishment of Christian councils of elders with jurisdiction over education and customary and family law. These concessions were resented by the Muslim community, while the Christians pressed for more, while maintaining their ultimate aim of Union with Greece.\n \n As tensions ran high in the island, and several petitions to the Sultan went unanswered, armed bands were formed, and the uprising was officially proclaimed in the year of $YEAR$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Hotly pursued, the desperate Wu Yazhong, with Liu and his Black Flag Army, crossed into Upper Tonkin in $YEAR$. \n \n Liu Yongfu soon established a profitable extortion network along the course of the Red River, ‘taxing’ river commerce between Son Tây and Lào Cai at a rate of 10%.

As Puyi cried, screaming that he did not want to leave his parents, he was forced into a palanquin that took him back to the Forbidden City.
