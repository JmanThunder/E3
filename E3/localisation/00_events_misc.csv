EVTDESC13003;The original Irish Republican Army (IRA) fought a guerrilla war against British rule in Ireland in the Irish War of Independence between 1919 and 1921. Following the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty on 6 December 1921, the IRA in the 26 counties that were to become the Irish Free State split between supporters and opponents of the Treaty.

EVTDESC13005;The Irish Civil War was a conflict that followed the Irish War of Independence and accompanied the establishment of the Irish Free State, an entity independent from the United Kingdom but within the British Empire. The civil war was waged between two opposing groups, the pro-treaty Provisional Government and the anti-treaty IRA, over the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The forces of the Provisional Government (which became the Free State in December 1922) supported the Treaty, while the anti-treaty opposition saw it as a betrayal of the Irish Republic (which had been proclaimed during the Easter Rising). Many of those who fought on both sides in the conflict had been members of the Irish Republican Army (Old IRA) during the War of Independence. The Civil War was won by the pro-treaty Free State forces, who benefited from substantial quantities of weapons provided by the British Government. The conflict may have claimed more lives than the War of Independence that preceded it, and left Irish society divided and embittered for generations. Today, two of the main political parties in the Republic of Ireland, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, are direct descendants of the opposing sides of the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The court has no standing to question the legality of their status of slaves under Spanish law, and would be a moot point, as the slaves would-under U.S. law-have to be returned to Spain to stand trial for their involvement in the mutiny and death of the crew.

It was arguably formed as a musical genre in 1912 with the publishing of Hart Wand’s ‘Dallas Blues,’ but has its roots in traditional slave songs of the 19th century.

EVTDESC21530;The Mandate of Heaven was a belief held by the Chinese of the right for the Manchu house to rule China. As long as the ruler was upright and virtuous, Heaven was appeased. If the ruler became wicked and corrupt, then Heaven would withdraw its Mandate and make it known to the people through disasters. In 1851, the Yellow River breached the north embankment near Kaifeng Prefecture in Henan and caused great devastation over the countryside of North China. It required some fifteen or more years to repair damages from this outbreak, and to confine the stream with new embankments. These disasters were indication to the Chinese people that the Manchurians were losing the Mandate of Heaven, the right to rule and govern China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC31261;Despite fierce fighting and purges of Greek leadership in reconquered regions, the Peloponnesian Greeks still will not accept Ottoman Rule. Knowing that we wish to expand our lands to the north, the Sultan now sends a proposal: if Egypt will assist the Empire in pacifying Greece, lands in the Levant will be transferred to Egyptian governance.\n \n This rebellion makes the Empire vulnerable, and we could simply seize Levantine lands by force, though we would be seen to betray our titular suzerain. Or, by accepting the Sultan’s proposal we stand to eventually gain the lands by entirely legitimate means… if the Empire keeps its promise. Which is the best course?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Second, Belgium could be recognized as a sovereign kingdom in its own right, but guaranteed as a neutral buffer state between France and northern Europe. Third, the Belgian territories could be partitioned for their protection, with the German-speaking east being taken into Prussia, the French-speaking south added to France, and the Dutch-speaking northwest established as a Principality of Antwerp guaranteed by a neutral Power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC37242;The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is a historic document that was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly at its third session on 10 December 1948 as Resolution 217 at the Palais de Chaillot in Paris, France. Of the then 58 members of the United Nations, 48 voted in favour, none against, eight abstained, and two did not vote. The Declaration consists of 30 articles affirming an individual’s rights which, although not legally binding in themselves, have been elaborated in subsequent international treaties, economic transfers, regional human rights instruments, national constitutions, and other laws. The Declaration was the first step in the process of formulating the International Bill of Human Rights, which was completed in 1966, and came into force in 1976, after a sufficient number of countries had ratified them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC44808;Not unexpectedly, Mexico has ignored the terms of the Treaties of Velasco-claiming that Santa Anna only agreed to them under duress. Indeed, Santa Anna himself has been quick to back up their claim even despite his precarious position. The one bright light in this? It might be the cause the American government has been looking for to intervene in our war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44850;After winning independence, Mexico’s elites had intended to establish a constitutional monarchy with an emperor chosen from a European noble house. However, Spain refused to recognize the new nation as legitimate, and other crowned heads hesitated. In the meantime, the popular general who had been made President of the Regency, Agustín de Iturbide, built support for his own claim to the throne-in 1822 he was crowned Mexico’s first emperor.\n After taking the throne, he quickly showed himself an absolutist, abolishing the elected parliament and suppressing all dissent. In the end his rule displeased both liberals, who had hoped for a constitutional monarchy or even a republic, and conservatives, who wanted a monarch from a proper European noble house rather than a military usurper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME44850;The First Mexican Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44851;The provinces of Guatemala in Central America united with Mexico shortly after their independence, but cultural and political differences between the two regions meant that Central America quickly chafed under Mexican rule. The Central American elites were deeply disappointed by Emperor Agustín’s coronation, and they soon began talks in Guatemala City about seceding again to form their own republican federation. In 1823 a proclamation announced the establishment of the United Provinces of Central America, comprising all of New Spain’s mainland territories southeast of the Yucatan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME44851;The United Provinces of Central America;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44852;Only months after Emperor Agustín I’s coronation, a group of generals and republican aristocrats began conspiring to overthrow him and establish a republic in Mexico. Chief among these was General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, who led a rebellion in Veracruz which successfully forced the Emperor to abdicate and go into exile. The victorious rebels published a document, called the Plan of Casa Mata, which called for the assembly of a new congress to draw up a constitution for representative government. In short order, elections were held to choose Mexico’s first democratically elected president.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME44852;The Plan of Casa Mata;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44853;In 1834, Mexico’s president Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna and his close supporters responded to agitation within the Catholic church about the legislature’s liberal, secular program by publishing a reactionary proclamation in which they abrogated Mexico’s federalist constitution of 1824, consolidated political authority to the central government, dissolved the elected parliament, and repealed a number of progressive laws passed by a recent rival government. This Plan of Cuernavaca essentially transformed Mexico into a centralized dictatorship, and many of the border territories in the far north and south moved toward rebellion against the new regime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME44853;The Plan of Cuernavaca;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44854;‘Since the beginning of the century many native groups, chiefly Cherokee, in the American South began to move westward due to American encroachment on their lands. Some settled just over the Mississippi River, but others went further west,’ across the Sabine River into Tejas. Before Mexico’s independence’, the Spanish authorities welcomed their presence, hoping to use them as a buffer against American expansion. In late 1822, the Cherokee sent American diplomat Richard Fields to Mexico City to negotiate with the new government for the acquisition of land grants. With them, they hoped to gain official recognition of ownership of the lands they currently inhabit. Accepting this request could encourage further migrations into the area, allowing for the land to develop and also safeguard the border. On the other hand, the numbers aren’t high enough to see benefits short-term. Perhaps it may be wise to also look elsewhere for more settler prospects.’;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME44854;Cherokee in Tejas;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44855;In 1820 Spain signed a contract with an American named Moses Austin authorizing him to bring several hundred families from America to settle and defend New Spain’s northern frontier, the territory of Tejas. The man then died, and Mexico soon won its independence, but Austin’s son, Stephen, took up the contract in his father’s stead, and the new Mexican government recognized the agreement. In the early 1820s thousands of settlers, mostly American, were enticed to the Tejas territory by land grants and minimal government oversight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME44855;Empresarios in Tejas;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44856;The frontier settlers brought into Tejas by the empresarios chafed under the increased taxes Santa Anna’s regime levied. Tensions rose in the early 1830s, and the Texans increasingly talked of secession from Mexico, perhaps to be followed by annexation to the United States, where most of them had come from. Finally, in October of 1835 a Texan militia rose up in rebellion and proclaimed the Republic of Texas. Mexican armies quickly marched north to crush the rebels, led by President Santa Anna himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC44857;As American settlers move west across the Mississippi River, concern has risen for the local native populations that moved in before them that history may repeat itself.

Our Foreign Minister contends that as long as Cuba remains in Spanish hands, Mexico will not be truly secure. He heads a growing movement to declare new war on our former masters and wrest Cuba from the Spanish crown. We worry, though, that the Americans also have designs on Cuba and might not look favourably upon our conquest of the island. If we are to pursue war with Spain, we should seek America’s support first.

EVTDESC46304;Paraguay has always suffered from its landlocked status in terms of commerce and communication with the rest of the world. Surrounded on three-quarters of its frontiers by the vastly larger Brazil and Argentina, it was impossible for this little state to emerge as the regional power of which Solano López dreamed. In the north, Brazil’s Mato Grosso province is thinly defended and rich in mineral resources, and in the south Corrientes and Entre Rios provinces, with questionable loyalties to Argentina, could provide a direct access to the sea. López sought a casus belli to start a war against Brazil or Argentina, and he found it in Uruguay, where the Colorado leader Flores rose up against the Blanco party and President Berro, who guaranteed Paraguay’s access to the Atlantic via the Rio de la Plata estuary. With restoring order in Uruguay we can secure our sea access, and hopefully drag Brazil or Argentina into the war-but beware, a war with both of them could be the end of our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC46330;There are a growing number of Freemasons within Brazilian churches, which is officially prohibited in Catholicism—they exist most commonly within Lay Fraternities, which are generally charitable organizations chiefly associated with local churches. Historically, however, the church in Brazil has been de facto an apparatus of the state, making religious issues in Brazil matters of the crown, as well as the cloth. Local bishops have been calling for Freemason clergymen to resign, and now a bishop named Dom Vital has issued an interdict against certain Lay Fraternities that have refused to expel their Freemason brothers, preventing any sacraments from being celebrated within these Fraternity buildings. The lay brothers say this constitutes a direct challenge to Brazil’s government, considering that notable members of Parliament are Freemasons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME46330;The Religious Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC46331;Dom Vital has refused to annul his controversial interdict, and has been joined in protest by the bishop Antonio de Macedo Costa, who has recently passed a similar interdict against uncooperative Lay Fraternities. This refusal could be used as a reason to arrest and imprison the bishops, hopefully preventing them from causing more trouble in the future, and to remove them as challenges to the authority of the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC46332;Vidal and Costa have been imprisoned for acting against the sovereign power of the Brazilian state, causing shock and anger amongst the Catholic populace in the country. The new Prime Minister, a Freemason and a Catholic himself, has threatened to resign if an imperial amnesty is not granted to Costa and Vidal. We must choose between unappealing alternatives.\n \n We can either back down and free the bishops, appeasing our people but making the crown look weak and indecisive, or we can stand by the bishops’ sentences and accept the dissolution of the current government and the outrage of the common folk. Which shall it be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC46410;As recently as the 1810s the territory east of the Rio de la Plata was part of our United Provinces, but the Luso-Brazilian monarchy conquered the province in 1820. Now Platinean partisans have organized a rebellion, led by a group of patriots who call themselves the Thirty-Three Easterners. They intend to declare independence and re-join our Union, and they have asked for our support as they resist Brazil’s oppression.

Control of the river is the key to trade throughout southern South America, and we would prefer that Montevideo not be in the hands of any strong nation.\n \n Our diplomatic corps has a cunning plan: we can offer to mediate between Brazil and the United Provinces, hinting at retaliation if either side refuses.

EVTDESC50006;After the War of the Pacific, a vigorous debate among civilian elites spawned the development of new political parties. Mining entrepreneurs, who had become the most important economic group in the country, created the Conservative Party. Conservatives favoured reaching a quick peace settlement with Chile that would include indemnification for lost territories and enable Bolivia to construct a railroad for mining exports. The Liberal Party denounced the pacifism of the Conservatives. Despite these differences, both parties were primarily interested in political and economic modernization, and their ideological outlooks were similar.

His second term was successfully completed in 1899 and was marked by his reconstruction of a devastated Peru by initiating fiscal, military, religious, and civil reforms.

EVTDESC50014;Various hostilities between the Argentine Confederation and the State of Buenos Aires culminated in the 1861 Battle of Pavón, and to victory on the part of Mitre and Buenos Aires over Urquiza’s national forces. President Santiago Derqui, who had been backed by Urquiza, resigned, and the Argentine Confederation was replaced by the Argentine Republic on December 17, 1861. Mitre, who despite victory reaffirmed his commitment to the 1860 constitutional amendments, was elected the republic’s first president in 1862.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC55560;After the loss of Alsace-Lorraine, the republic that was proclaimed early in the afternoon of Saturday, November 9, 1918, is often called the ‘accidental republic.’ When Friedrich Ebert, the leader of the so-called Majority Socialists, accepted the imperial chancellorship from Max von Baden, it was with the understanding that he would do his utmost to save the imperial system from revolution. Ebert believed that the only way to accomplish this would be by transforming Germany into a constitutional monarchy. Elections would have to be held for a constituent assembly, whose task it would be to draw up a new constitution…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Protests opposing Rhee were started by student and labour groups in Masan on 11 April after the discovery of a local high school student killed by police during the rigged elections demonstrations in March. Popular discontent over Rhee’s autocratic rule, corruption, use of violence against political opposition, and poor development of South Korea led to large student protests in Seoul, which were violently suppressed and 180 people were killed. Rhee resigned on 26 April before fleeing to exile in the United States, and was replaced by Yun Posun, beginning the transition to the Second Republic of South Korea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The crown prince insists that he will carry on as Regent of Brazil, and it seems he has the support of many aggrieved Brazilian nobles and notables, who deeply resent Brazil’s reduced status under the new constitution. The parliament is somewhat at a loss as to how it should rein in this rogue royal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME97022;Dom Pedro’s Refusal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97023;The die is cast. Hostilities between Brazilian independentists and Portuguese loyalists have erupted into open rebellion in America, and Dom Pedro has definitively taken the side of the rebellion. The Cortes sent the prince a letter informing him in no uncertain terms that the Brazilian government in Rio de Janeiro had been dissolved and that all who defied the Portuguese court would be punished by force. It is said that, upon reading the letter, Pedro immediately mounted his horse, drew his sword, and proclaimed Brazil’s ties to Portugal forever severed. It seems that war is now inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME97023;The Cry of Ipiranga;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC97025;Brazil stands victorious, and is now welcomed into the community of nations as a free and sovereign state.

May our realm prosper and grow in peace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME97025;The Brazilian Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97026;The new absolutist regime has suspended the constitution of 1822 and says it is determined to restore Brazil’s colonial dependency upon Portugal.

EVTNAME97027;Demands of the Absolutists;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97028;A fiery speech delivered in parliament today is the talk of the nation. The impassioned orator decried Brazil’s continued subordination to a crown four thousand miles away. Is it not time, he asked, that Brazil stood on its own and sought its own destiny? He speaks for a growing number of our people who feel that we have drifted apart from Portugal, that the Portuguese monarchy has done little to deserve our continued loyalty. Many believe it is time for full independence, and an end to the United Kingdom. Are we prepared to send an ultimatum to the Portuguese Cortes insisting on full Brazilian independence? Or, must the people’s cry for freedom go unheard?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME97028;Full Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97029;A worrisome political movement in Brazil has begun to agitate for full independence from Portugal, and it seems now to have infected the Brazilian political class, as well. The regional government in Rio de Janeiro has submitted an ultimatum to the Cortes, announcing Brazil’s intention to dissolve the United Kingdom and form an independent state. Of course, such a step would be intolerable for Portugalâ€¦ unless we don’t believe we can stop it. Acceding to Brazil’s demands without a fight would humiliate Portugal and enrage our nationalists, but the only alternative now seems to be war. What is Portugal’s response?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME97029;A Brazilian Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97030;The king has died, and Portugal is faced with a dilemma. His older son, Pedro, is a constitutionalist and liberal darling, but he recently rebelled against his father and became Emperor of Brazil. The king’s younger son, Miguel, is an absolutist and has the support of the reactionary aristocracy, but he has been in exile since a failed coup attempt.\n If Pedro succeeded his father, it would bring Portugal and Brazil into a personal union, an outcome neither nation now wants. Instead, Pedro means to pass the Portuguese crown directly to his daughter, Maria da Gloria, after swearing that the Constitution will be upheld. Miguel, for his part, would take the crown and likely abolish the Cortes and the constitution, restoring absolute rule. Either ruler would provoke a backlash from the opposing camp. How will this crisis be resolved?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME97030;The Death of John VI;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97031;Portugal is in the midst of a succession crisis, with late King John VI’s two sons struggling over the crown and the constitution. Pedro, previously the Brazilian Emperor, is now raising a liberal rebellion against the absolutist Miguel, and he has the support of the bourgeoisie in Porto and the Azores. With a small injection of arms and funds from us, his faction could likely restore constitutional rule in Portugal. Can we spare some ships and soldiers to covertly foment this rebellion?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME97031;Intervention in Portugal?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97039;Portugal’s dominant position on the Iberian Peninsula makes the formation of a pan-Iberian federation a real possibility. However, an increased emphasis on the nation’s Iberian identity would likely upset our citizens overseas, who feel less attached to their Iberian heritage. Further, the formation of a Brazilian-Iberian state would seriously disturb the balance of power in Europe, upsetting the other Great Powers and risking their intervention. We could unite all of Iberia with Brazil and suffer the consequences to our reputation, or compromise by forming an Iberian Federation and devolving home rule to a Brazilian government. Or, we could turn our backs on the Iberian project and preserve our unification with Brazil. Which way does Portugal’s destiny lie?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC97040;The regions of Upper and Lower Peru are linked by centuries of history, trade and politics. After independence, popular sentiment in both countries favoured unification to form a great Confederation of the Perus. However, Simon Bolivar opposed such a confederation because it could challenge his Colombian federation for dominance among the former Spanish territories. His forces installed a friend as president in Bolivia as the war with the Spanish ended, but the Peruvian government believed that unification could be achieved if a change of leadership in Bolivia could be arranged, perhaps by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

After independence, popular sentiment in both countries favoured unification to form a great Confederation of the Perus. However, Simon Bolivar opposed such a confederation because it could challenge his Colombian federation for dominance among the former Spanish territories.

EVTDESC97042;Bolivia has repulsed our attacks, this time. Our interest in unification remains, and they may be convinced yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97043;Peru has forced out the Colombia-friendly government in Bolivia, and even now they are beginning negotiations to establish a Peruvian confederation to our south.

EVTNAME97043;War with Peru?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97045;Both Bolivia and Peru now agree that a confederation must be formed between our nations. Unfortunately, we cannot seem to agree upon a political structure for that new polity. Essentially, both governments intend to dominate the confederation, and both are unwilling to concede any power to the other. Negotiations are ongoing, but little progress seems to be forthcoming. Perhaps we should simplify the process by letting arms speakâ€¦;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC97600;Meaning ‘locked country’, Sakoku was the foreign relations policy of Japan instituted by the Tokugawa shogunate in the 17th century, with no foreigner allowed to enter the country on pain of death.

When a Japanese soldier, Private Shimura Kikujiro, failed to return to his post, Chinese regimental commander Ji Xingwen received a message from the Japanese demanding permission to enter Wanping to search for the missing soldier.

After the Japanese loss of the Philippines, Koiso in turn was replaced by Admiral Kantaro Suzuki. The Allies captured the nearby islands of Iwo Jima and Okinawa in the first half of 1945. Okinawa was to be a staging area for Operation Downfall, the Allied invasion of the Japanese Home Islands. Following Germany’s defeat, the Soviet Union began quietly redeploying its battle-hardened European forces to the Far East, in addition to about forty divisions that had been stationed there since 1941, as a counterbalance to the million-strong Kwantung Army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

However, Kwantung Army commander-in-chief General Shigeru Honjo instead ordered his forces to proceed to expand operations all along the South Manchuria Railway.

As the editor of the Pesti Hirlap he has talked about the great economic and societal problems within Hungary, advocated full national autonomy within the Habsburg Empire, the immediate emancipation of the serfs-with no compensation to aristocrats-and an end of noble privileges. He has also promoted industrialization by founding the Gyáralapito és Kereskedelmi Társaság (Factory-Founding and Commercial Society).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Hungarians will not settle for anything less than an autonomous national government. Széchényi István, the very man who started the call for reforms in 1825, writes articles attacking the Pesti Hirlap and Kossuth himself, and together with the moderates, they either join the radicals or like Széchényi drift towards the conservatives.

Attacks ascribed to Jack the Ripper typically involved female prostitutes who lived and worked in the slums of the East End of London whose throats were cut prior to abdominal mutilations. The removal of internal organs from at least three of the victims led to proposals that their killer had some anatomical or surgical knowledge. The ‘From Hell’ letter received by George Lusk of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee included half of a preserved human kidney, purportedly taken from one of the victims.

EVTDESC110081;Captain Lord George Paulet had become captain of HMS Carysfort in 1841, serving on the Pacific Station of the Royal Navy. While stationing in Honolulu, he quickly found himself in the middle of a feud between the British Consul Charlton and the Prime Minister of Hawaii, an American named Judd. The former claimed that British subjects in the Islands were being denied their legal rights: thus, when Paulet arrived at Honolulu, he requested an audience with King Kamehameha III, tensions quickly rose between the locals, their American allies and the British elites-especially after Paulet militarily occupied the Islands. Each side is now sending envoys to defend themselves in the courts and the eyes of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC110082;After a failed attempt to cultivate tea in $COUNTRY$ in 1882 with seeds from India, Prince Mohammad Mirza known as ‘Kashef Al Saltaneh’ who was born in Lahijan, imported Indian tea and started its cultivation in Lahijan. Kashef, who was the first mayor of Tehran and an Iranian ambassador to India under British rule, knew that the British would not allow him to learn about the secrets of tea production, as it was it is their biggest business in India. So being fluent in French, the prince pretended to be a French labourer and started to work in the tea plantations and factories to learn how to produce tea. Ultimately his plan was to take back some samples of this tea to $COUNTRY$ to cultivate. He was successful in this endeavour only because of his diplomatic immunity which stopped the British from searching his secretly stashed sample. At the time, Kashef brought 3000 saplings into his country from the Northern part of India, Kangra and he started the cultivation in the region Gilan, south of the Caspian Sea. The climate there was well suited for tea cultivation, and the tea industry quickly expanded in Gilan and Mazanderan region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC110088;Father Roberto Landel de Moura was ordained to the priesthood in 1886 in Rome, where he also studied the physical sciences. A famous local inventor, he got recognized by his broadcast of a human voice over 8 km around Sao Paulo-a technological feet of note!

EVTDESC113901;Some prospectors in Ballarat have struck a huge gold nugget, found only 3 cm below the surface, near a bark of a tree on a slope leading to what is known as Bulldog Gully. Its gross weight is 109.59 kg and the trimmed weight is 78 kg. At the time of the discovery there were no scales capable of weighing a nugget this large, so it was broken into three pieces on an anvil by Dunolly-based blacksmith Archibald Wall. The nugget was soon melted down and the gold was sent as ingots to Melbourne for forwarding to the Bank of $COUNTRY$. It still remains the biggest gold nugget ever found.\n All around Australia, this finding triggered gold rushes, prospecting and expeditions. Melbourne, while not having any gold mines directly, is the place where all the gold wealth from Victoria trickles down to, which is causing a gold rush to the city in itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC131511;‘Der Judenstaat’ (‘The State of the Jews’) was a book written by the Jewish journalist Theodor Herzl, and it was published in 1896 in Leipzig and Vienna. As expressed in this book, Herzl envisioned the founding of a future independent Jewish state during the 20th century, noting the possibility of forming such a state in Argentina. It is considered one of the most important texts of early Zionism, indeed much popularizing the term ‘Zionism’ which was originally coined by the Jewish thinker Nathan Birnbaum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Only five years after the tragic end of the January Uprising, the pamphlets ridiculed the idea of armed national uprisings and suggested a compromise with Poland’s enemies, especially the Austrian Empire, and more concentration on economic growth than on political independence.

Among their flimsy shanties and squalid alleys, a champion has risen among them. He preaches a new system to the hopeless masses in which every willing man and woman has a job and is provided for. A system in which the rich do not prey upon the weak. Factory workers across the state are heeding his words and the capitalists are fearful of the consequences.

Now he is being shuffled about, moved from one parish to another, in order to cover up the story and secure the church’s reputation.

Since the authorities have no leads, members of our primary culture have taken it upon themselves to seek retribution on the minority and anti-minority sentiments are becoming widespread. The local government has turned a blind eye to the whole matter and let the attacks of retribution be carried out. Many people in $STATENAME$ are now calling for severe restrictions to be placed upon the minorities in the nation. Bringing the retribution-seeking attackers to justice probably will not abate the anti-minority sentiments.

EVTDESC141101;Minorities in $STATENAME$ are starting to gather and protest over the right to own property. Dishonest landowners in the state have repeatedly abused the minorities by collecting rent and then evicting them on false charges. The minorities have little legal recourse as their rights are almost non-existent. Recently, a family of immigrants who were wrongfully evicted from their residence died from exposure during an extremely cold night. Newspapers have picked up the story and are inflaming public opinion against our residency laws. We could let the anti-residency sentiments grow,’ or we could pay off some newspapers to run an opposing story detailing the ‘‘uncouth and devious’’ nature of the minority’s culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC141201;Minorities in $STATENAME$ have gradually lifted themselves out of poverty and into the middle class. They have started their own sports organizations, newspapers, and religious centres. A particularly racist and sharply divided town in $STATENAME$ has voted in a series of laws that effectively bans a large minority’s most important cultural festival. The laws probably would not have garnered enough votes if cultural minorities were allowed to vote. The debate about spreading full citizenship to minorities is raging among the state’s newspapers and those in favour of full citizenship seem to be gaining the most sympathy. To stop this movement, we could stage an arson attack on the racist town’s city hall and make it look like the minority was behind it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC190130;For years Borneo has been a common destination for Chinese workers and settlers, many of whom are enticed to work for the rich sultans of the island in precious metal mining communities-kongsi, as they are called by the Chinese. In 1777, a Hakka Chinese named Luo Fangbo established one kongsi in Pontianak as a full-fledged independent republic, co-existing peacefully the with neighbouring sultans. It has helped protect Chinese settlers in Borneo for decades now, and as the first republic in the history of Asia, is a remarkably modern state for its time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190131;The Lanfang Republic is, although independent, a tributary state of the Qing Empire, and must pay occasional sums of money to the Emperor. In exchange, they ensure that new Chinese settlers from the mainland arrive safely in our capital, providing for a larger workforce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC190300;A new heretical religious movement is forming in our lands, as a man proclaiming himself ‘the Bab’ is doing away with the old interpretations of the Quran. Instead he is offering his own interpretation of the text, looking for hidden meaning behind every individual letter. His radical new interpretation already sits poorly with the ulama—the religious authorities, but his claim to authority to do so is what really infuriates them. He claims that the Qa’im [the redeemer] has arrived and that his is in contact with Him [he is the gate-Bab-to the Qa’im].\n \n Not satisfied with proclaiming himself just the Bab, in his rising popularity he is now proclaiming that he is indeed the Qa’im himself. And as Qa’im he has the authority to abrogate the Sharia. An act which was pushing it too far for the ulama: They have declared his movement heretical and are demanding that the Bab be put to death as an apostate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC190301;One of the core teachings of the heretic the Bab is the imminent arrival of ‘He whom God shall make manifest’, or the messiah who shall establish God’s kingdom on Earth. Long have the Babis been on the lookout for such a man, and now one by the name of Baha’u’llah claims to be him. While incarcerated in the Siyah-Chal prison, he claims to have had a vision from the ‘Maid of Heaven’ proclaiming him the ‘best beloved of the worlds’ and having the ‘power of the Sovereign within him.’ In other words, he is the one prophesied.\n \n Baha’u’llah’s claim is rapidly gaining acceptance among the Babis, and his presence in our realm is sure to reinvigorate the Babi cause and increase their militancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Amongst these people is a man named Baha’u’llah, who claims to the fulfilment of the Babi prophecy of a man coming ‘whom God shall make manifest’ and restore the kingdom of God to Earth. With this claim he is rapidly absorbing leadership of the Babi movement and turning it into the Baha’i Faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

This all changed when a prominent religious scholar issued a fatwa (religious ruling) declaring it forbidden for Muslims to consume tobacco sold by ‘infidels’ and ‘foreigners’. Since then the-previously allied to our interests-clergy have joined in the protest, and many in Persia have stopped smoking.

This has greatly reduced expenses and strengthened the position of the central government, but it has also upset a large number of nobles who lost their patronage. Together with Tanzimat inspired breaking of the ulama, the reforms have given the central government undisputed authority. But not just of the central authority, but also of Amir Kabir.

Being subject to the jizya as well as harassment by Muslims, they are subject to both formal and informal persecution.\n \n The Parsi people-Zoroastrian co-religionists from India-are appalled by the deplorable situation Zoroastrians find themselves in our empire.

As harvests fail a major famine is developing. Bread is getting scarcer resulting in the price of bread doubling in Tehran, tripling in Isfahan and increasing more than 20-fold in some rural areas. As a result of these high prices those still holding grain have started hoarding their supply in the hopes of fetching a premium.

EVTDESC190344;A concession we granted to a British baron by the name of Julius de Reuter is causing quite a stir among the populace. Under the terms of the concession baron de Reuter has the sole right to exploit all new forests, mines and industry. In exchange building a railroad and providing the treasury with a fixed sum for 5 years plus 60% of net revenue for 20 years.\n To the populace this is evidence that the country is slowly being taken over by kafirs, and not just any kind of kafir, but a Jew of all people. This has resulted the ulama to uniting in opposition to the concession. They have succeeded in convincing the people that this concession will bring with it infidels and moral corruption.\n The Russian Legation has also come out against this concession. Giving such sweeping power to a single person is irreconcilable with their interest, and they will not accept it.\n Lastly, the British government has made it known that they cannot support this concession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Something which can only be considered a clear provocation by the Muslims populace, though some claim it was a veiled women who put it there.

However, while most enthusiastically joined in, as the ban dragged on many found that stopping smoking was more difficult than anticipated. Not only is smoking thoroughly ingrained in Persian culture, it is also terribly addictive. As time wore on slowly people started circumventing the ban and started smoking again. As the fatwa lost influence, so did the hold of the ulama on the people decline.

EVTDESC190359;According to Islamic law it is forbidden for a women to be in contact with an unrelated male, they are even barely allowed to show themselves to unrelated males. This has left women to spend most of their lives in the private world of the family. This has become so engrained in our culture that a common name for a wife is manzel: ‘the home.’ Rich or poor, women are confined to, and devote their entire lives to, the family. Unless girls are born into well-to-do families, their birth is less enthusiastically welcomed. In some families it has gotten to the point that it is a nang (social disgrace) to give birth to girls.\n Yet women are not some mindless automaton, they have a will and mind of their own.

Forbidden by Islamic law to interact with, or even being seen by, unrelated males, women live a hidden life behind closed doors. On the rare occasions that they do venture out, they do so ‘wrapped in black bags from head to the toe without even an opening to breathe.’ Yet, it would be a mistake to consider women to be powerless bystanders. From the tobacco protests to the Constitutional Revolution, they have been at the forefront of all public protests in recent history. Yet society does not recognise this.

The journal, however, is more than just a collection of amusing tales and anecdotes. It is a poignant satire of the clergy and the establishment and is more than happy to expose its corruption. But more than that, the paper is a call to modernise and accept more advanced Western social norms and practises. It viciously attacks what it perceives to be the backward lifestyles and values of the Islamic clergy and religious fanatics.\n Being richly illustrated it is not only accessible to the literate elite, but has also become a hit among the lower-illiterate-classes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

However, power by far and large still resides with the old elites who are thoroughly uninterested in economic reform, and would rather enrich themselves at the expense of the tojjar. We’ve been approached by a small group of tojjar who are demanding the removal of the ineffective and corrupt government officials and replace them with religious, unbiased and not avaricious men. Furthermore, they are demanding we install merchants’ assemblies in prominent cities and ports to represent the merchants interests and settle matters of commercial disputes, while promoting commerce and protecting merchants from foreign competition.\n The old elites, however, feeling threatened in their position, have allied with the ulama in opposition to the formation of these merchant councils.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

One of the greatest opponents of the ulama is prime-minister Amir Kabir. Who, while working for the border committee instituted by the Second Treaty of Erzurum, closely followed the Tanzimat reforms of the Ottoman Empire and came to the conclusion that the only way to modernise and strengthen the empire is by limiting the power and influence of the ulama.\n He has now proposed measures to this effect.

But where the anjoman find fertile ground for growth among the more reform minded classes-and are slowly readying the minds of the general populace for change-the ulama is less than enthusiastic of their ideas. In their eyes many of the anjoman serve to spread corrupt ideas, shelter infidels, promote harmony between Muslims and non-Muslims, and, above all, constitute religious innovation contrary to Islamic precepts.

During their brief tenure over the East Indies [1811-1814] they had the opportunity to install a new sultan, one which has proven less than friendly to our interest, but very much so to theirs. However, his rule was not meant to last: Through ‘interventions’ we’ve managed to install a sultan more favourable to our interests, but his authority outside of the city of Palembang is limited. Brigands and robbers roam the countryside, and the local Heads appear unable or unwilling to control them. Our commissionaire in the sultanate has expressed his desire to take a more direct role in ruling the state, and has asked us to enter into a new contract with the sultan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME211202;The Sultanate of Palembang;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC211203;The recent treaty with the sultanate of Palembang installed a sultan more amiable to our wishes, and was intended to provide a solid basis for stable relations. But alas our hopes were in vain: the sultan has proven too weak and extremely unreliable. Due taxes are no longer being paid, and it would seem he is behind the recent assassination of our commissionaire to the sultanate.\n \n But all this is all rather irrelevant: Our post in Palembang is under siege by inlanders, and it would appear the sultan is behind this! To restore order, and maintain our authority, something has to be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Throughout history we’ve fought many wars for control over Flores and Timor, and have now more or less settled on the Dutch controlling western Flores and Timor and us controlling eastern Flores and Timor. The Dutch have since greatly expanded their control over the archipelago, and are extracting vast wealth from the region. Our territories on the other hand are greatly impoverished, and our control over them is limited. Selling them would not be a great loss to us, were it not for the fact that we would lose all influence in the region.

Decapitated, body mutilated, head found on display at a local kebab place, just terrible. The Russians are, understandably, somewhat upset about this, and are threatening war to avenge Griboyedov.

Lastly, we should not forget the Wahabis raiding our pilgrims to Mecca and Karbala, something the Ottomans are not combatting and sometimes engaging in themselves.\n Should we decided to press the issue, the Russian Tsar has promised his support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

However, tensions remain high as ever, and peace is bought at a bloody price as Russian Viceroy Yermolov employs a reign of terror to subdue the Caucasian tribes. Yet that is not the only source of tension: Yermolov accuses us of not fulfilling the territorial clauses of the Treaty, claiming Kapan belongs to Russia. Of course, it does not, but he has occupied the northern shore of lake Gokcha—a position from where he can threaten Erivan—to force us to the negotiation table. How should we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Yermolov, claiming we have failed in our obligation to evacuate Kapan, continues to press our northern border. Now he has seized control over more territory around Lake Gokcha, and is now in a position to directly threaten Erivan. Yet this aggressive action belies the truth of the Russian's situation: Their empire is at the verge of civil war, with Russian princes are at each other's throat, fighting for the throne. There are those who say the time to strike Russians is now: To avenge the continued humiliation the Russians subject us too and liberate our Muslim brethren from Yermolov's oppression!

EVTDESC301059;The Council of Sultanieh—the yearly army review and the opportunity to pay homage to the Persian Shah—was quite an eventful occasion this year. Wild voices were pushing for war, to restore the Persian Empire in the Caucasus and, by radical fanatics—the ulama—in specific, to avenge the 'atrocities' commit against the peoples of the Caucasus. Yet we also had allies at court arguing for restraint and the futility of war against us. In the end, however, the deciding voice was our emissary who managed to convince the Shah that there was no ill will on our part. His audience with the Shah was even so successful, that the Shah has resorted to settling some minor border disputes around $PROVINCENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC301060;Yermolov is making outrages accusation to our address: He purported to have intercepted a caravan leaving Erivan carrying silver and arms for the Caucasians fighting their Russian oppressors. He claims that these actions were directed by Abbas Mirza under a policy of 'no peace, no war', which aims to strengthen Mirza's position as crown prince by stirring up trouble for the Russians in the Caucasus. Yermolov is demanding the right to build military posts on the road from Tabriz to Erivan to intercept future shipments of arms destined for the rebels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301060;No Peace, No War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301061;Long have we suspected the court of Tabriz of stirring up trouble in the Caucasus under a policy of 'no peace, no war' in order to strengthen Abbas Mirza's claim to the Persian throne. And recently we finally found the evidence we need: A caravan leaving from Erivan carrying Persian silver and arms destined for the Caucasian rebels.

As a result, Viceroy Yermolov has now blockaded Erivan to force them into submission, and end their support for the rebels. The Shah has made it known to us that he had no knowledge of the involvement of Erivan in the affair, and leaves it to us how to settle the matter with the court of Erivan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The internationally recognized Turkish government at the time was that of Sultan Mehmed VI, but it was not party to the Treaty of Moscow.

After the fire, the Reichstag Fire Decree was passed. The Nazi Party used the fire as a pretext that communists were plotting against the German government, and the event is considered pivotal in the establishment of Nazi Germany.

Its practical effects were limited, since the Italo-German and Japanese operational theatres were on opposite sides of the world and the high contracting powers had disparate strategic interests.

Some time ago a lesser khan by the name of Kenesary Kasymov found his winter pastures blocked by a clan loyal to us. Enraged, he has taken his band of followers on a might rampage across the steppes: raiding, raping, murder his neighbouring clans. This thuggery has coerced the other clans into a form of quiet submission to Kenesary. Feeling empowered, he has declared himself the Great Khan of the Kazakh people and called upon all Kazakhs to join him as he turns his attention to our Empire, promising vicious retribution to all who will not obey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC375007;The 'Great' Khan of the Kazakhs now lies dead in some nameless gorge deep in the Kyrzyk mountains, his head brought to us by a local khan called Ormon. It seems like the Kazakhs had enough of his continuing bullying and terrorizing, and decided to turn on him.\n \n Apparently they have lost their taste for the anarchy called freedom and prefer the stability and prosperity brought by our rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC599999;For the sake of stability, tsarism insisted on rigid autocracy that effectively shut out the population from participation in government. At the same time, to maintain its status as a great power, it promoted industrial development and higher education, which were inherently dynamic. The result was perpetual tension between government and society, especially its educated element, known as the intelligentsia. This tension and the intelligentsia publishing works criticizing the government, the hardships of war and the technological backwardness of Russia that was demonstrated during the defeat at the Crimean War are contributing to an increase in militancy and consciousness among our people.

EVTDESC1000200;Now that we are powerful enough to hold our own, an important matter rose up regarding our role in the Eastern Christendom. It is a well-known fact that the Byzantine Empire for a long time was the centre of the Orthodox Church and the Eastern Christendom as a whole. Sadly, we’ve lost our authority and power due to numerous wars and raids and our title as the protector was taken by another powerful Orthodox nation known as the Russian Empire. We are glad that they’ve been doing our work for centuries now, but it’s time that we take this title back since it’s supposed to be us that should protect the Eastern Christians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It was given the task of leading fights against their bitter enemies, the Socialists. They may have numbered 200,000 by the time of Mussolini’s March on Rome from 27 to 29 October 1922. In 1922 the squadristi were reorganized into the milizia and formed numerous bandiere, and on 1 February 1923 the Blackshirts became the Voluntary Militia for National Security, which lasted until the 8 September 1943 Armistice of Cassibile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

While we could drag the war on and see if the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have the wherewithal to finish their assault, it might be in our best interest to give them a concession port and reparations.

EVTDESC1500001;The geopolitical context of this conflict is linked to the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire which was a direct consequence of World War I and involvement of the Ottomans in the Middle Eastern theatre. The Greeks received an order to land in Smyrna by the Triple Entente as part of the partition. During this war, the Ottoman government collapsed completely and the Ottoman Empire was divided amongst the victorious Entente powers with the signing of the Treaty of Sevres on August 10, 1920.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1512058;The question of internal organisation was important in the new kolkhozes. The most basic measure was to divide the workforce into a number of groups, generally known as brigades, for working purposes. It was already normal practice for the large kolkhoz of 200-400 households to be divided into temporary or permanent work units of 15-30 households.’ The authorities gradually came down in favour of the fixed, combined brigade, that is the brigade with its personnel, land, equipment and draught horses fixed to it for the whole period of agricultural operations, and taking responsibility for all relevant tasks during that period. The brigade was headed by a brigade leader. This was usually a local man (a few were women).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC3032530;One of the first events of the restarted Caucasian War was General Volkhovski’s landing in Circassia, near the modern town of Sochi.

EVTDESC3032536;Imam Shamil has stated his demands regarding the Caucasus: Independence, a return to the status quo of 1834, or death!

EVTDESC3032540;Historically, soon after major victories in the Caucasus, the Russians purged the area of any undesirable elements. The ethnic cleansing continued until the 1870s, as many natives of the area were killed or deported to the Ottoman Empire. Indeed, the ethnic cleansing of the area has been considered by many historians to be the first ethnic cleansing on a modern scale and the harbinger of genocides as a concept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC3032541;Historically, Imam Shamil was captured in 1859. The Russians allowed him to live, albeit under surveillance in Kiev. The mutual respect that the Imam and the Tsar had for each other helped quite a bit in this aspect, and Imam Shamil saw the war as lost from this point. Although resistance continued in the Caucasus, the ideological centre of the movement was removed, and the ideological foundation of the resistance foundered. Imam Shamil himself received permission from the Tsar to go on the Hajj to Mecca in 1869. He briefly stopped at Istanbul where he was greeted warmly by the Ottoman Sultan, but continued on his way to Mecca. He died shortly after completing the pilgrimage in 1871, a truly remarkable figure in life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

During the raid of their headquarters, Shevchenko’s new poem, ‘The Dream’, was found. This poem personally attacked the Tsar Nicholas I and his wife. Although Tsar Nicholas personally read the poem, and was quite amused at the parts attacking him, he purportedly flew into a rage when the poem attacked his wife. Although a pardon for Shevchenko was likely, the attack against the Tsar’s wife was the last straw, and Shevchenko was thrown into custody.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The purpose of the campaign was to reunify China, which had become fragmented in the aftermath of the Revolution of 1911.

The split was partially motivated by Chiang’s purging of communists within the KMT, which marked the end of the First United Front.

EVTDESC146610102;When Bolivia became independent from Spain on 1825, it took possession of the territories that corresponded to its colonial administration in accordance with the uti possidetis juris of 1810. Bolivia claimed the maritime territory westward from the Andes to the Pacific Ocean between the Rio Salado on the south and the Rio Loa on the north, which included part of the Atacama Desert. Later in the mid-19th century, Chile made claims to the desert area following the discovery and exploitation of nitrate deposits and the move en masse of its population to work in the new found richness in Antofagasta. Because of that, the following decades were witness to much bloodshed on the borders of Bolivia, Peru and Chile. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has put a proposal, with international approval, to solve this problem amicably and set terms for new borders, paying indemnities for all involved.

The basis of the dispute is the advocacy of a particular division of the territory deriving from a mid-nineteenth-century survey commissioned by the country that owns Guyana. This division is known as the ‘Schomburgk Line ‘, after the German naturalist who surveyed the territory. In October 1886 they declared the Line to be the provisional frontier of Guiana with $COUNTRY$, and in February 1887 $COUNTRY$ severed diplomatic relations.

EVTNAMEOUTBREAK_PLAYER_VICTORY;The Battle of $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCOUTBREAK_PLAYER_VICTORY_NATION;New tactics and equipment developed since the initial outbreak have helped suppress the zombie outbreak. Traditionally, our men were taught to shoot for the chest because it is the hardest to miss. Since the initial outbreak, they have been trained to shoot for the head and disable a zombie in one go. Likewise, the new Standard Infantry Rifle (SIR) has been developed as a more accurate and semi-automatic alternative to traditional rifles. On a unit-level, soldiers were taught to fire with mechanical precision and alternate with a partner: one soldier shoots while the other reloads. Effectively, the advent of repeating rifles and new military tactics have led us to ultimate victory against the zombie hordes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCOUTBREAK_SOE_END;It is no longer necessary to allocate so much of our government’s resources to the military. As such, we’ve restored the bureaucracy and returned power to the government proper. No longer shall our country be under military jurisdiction and its corrupt junta!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEOUTBREAK_SOE_END;Government Powers Restored!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCOUTBREAK_SOF_END;Alongside the state of emergency came a classification system to measure the intensity of a zombie outbreak. Class One outbreaks, for example, occur in rural areas and experience minimal casualties. Class Two outbreaks, meanwhile, occur in urban areas, but can be suppressed by local authorities. Then, Class Three outbreaks present a clear threat to national security and require the regular military to suppress the outbreak. Fortunately, our military crushed the zombie outbreak at Class Three and prevented the breakdown of law, or a Class Four outbreak. While there are nations that teeter between Class Three and Four outbreaks, ours is only endangered by isolated Class One outbreaks. Therefore, your advisors have come and ask that you end the state of emergency. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCOUTBREAK_SOF_START;By declaring a state of emergency, we have suspended the normal functions of the executive, legislative, and judicial powers and handed extensive political control over to the military. As such, elections are suspended and we’ve pulled together emergency funds and resources to combat the zombie menace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCOUTBREAK_START;One of our ambassadors reports that a strange plague broke out in some remote location. Though nobody important really cares, there are some who claim this is a resurgence of the legendary Solomon Virus and a sign of the coming Rapture. A passage from Zechariah describes it as such: ‘This will be the plague the Lord strikes all people who warred against Jerusalem: their flesh shall rot while they stand on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths. On that day, a large-scale panic from the Lord will spread among them. One person will grab the hand of another, and one will attack the other.’;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCOUTBREAK_START_LOCAL;They call it the Solomon Virus. It travels through the bloodstream, enters the brain, and uses the cells of the frontal lobe to replicate. However, this section of the brain is destroyed in the process and all bodily functions cease. Alive but dormant, the brain is slowly transformed by the virus into a completely new organ whose most notable trait is its independence from oxygen. By removing this all-important resource, the body is no longer dependent on complex support mechanisms such as the heart and lungs. Once mutation is complete, the new organ reanimates the body to transfer the virus. Historically, outbreaks of virus were few and far between, occurring infrequently in Ancient Egypt, Israel, and even noted to be the cause of Roman Order XXXVII and the construction of Hadrian’s Wall. Some of the most recent cases include the ‘mysterious’ disappearance of the Roanoke Island settlers in 1587 and a 1762 outbreak on St. Lucia in the Caribbean. That is, of course, until today… (Advice: Use Revolt risk Map mode to track infected provinces, 9 brigades minimum to prevent or remove infections though more than that is recommended due to brigades defecting, infected ports in the same continent cause infections you can declare war & blockade to stop the spread).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCOUTBREAK_TETW;Civilization has completely broken down, and law is no longer kept. Any densely populated area in the world has thousands of zombies walking the streets. The world’s population has been reduced to almost nothing, and the number of survivors has been limited to fewer than 500000 The world leaders that haven’t already been slaughtered are hiding in bunkers, waiting to starve to death. To quote a contemporary biologist, ‘No help will come for anyone as the zombies slowly devour all life on the planet causing the end of humanity and eventually the end of all life on earth due to the rapid removal of so many creatures from the global ecosystem. After a time, the zombies will all rot away leaving the earth an empty barren wasteland.’;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCZ999101;Parts of our country have recently fallen under zombie control, and neither the local government nor the military have been able to restore order. Since we are unable to maintain control over the area, our people and the international community have come to refer to it as Zombieland’: A wasteland where all societal structure has collapsed and where zombies roam freely. Future habitation will require extensive reconstruction and repopulation we estimate that the province’s human population is less than 20% of what it was in 1836, if not lower…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC42069;Under the red-eyed glare of Austria, the increasingly hazy leader of the German Confederation, comes the burning inevitability that all our ambitions of conquest will go up in smoke. We must be careful not to set too high our sights, as though we can attempt to hash out our differences, the bubbling fury of the major powers of the Confederation will certainly render blunt our attempts at warfare, even among the weeds and worms of irrelevant German states.\n \n NOTE: This event grants 5 infamy whenever a minor state in the German Confederation falls below 7 infamy. This reduces the frequency of wars within the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
