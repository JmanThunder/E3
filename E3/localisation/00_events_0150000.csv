EVTDESC160001;We are receiving disturbing reports of anarchy in southern China. A peasant army led by the rebels Feng Yunshan and Wei Changhui has declared the ascendancy of the so-called ‘Heavenly Kingdom’ and driven out local governors. All within the Qing government agree that we cannot recognize these rebels as having credence-if we do, it raises the question of whether the Mandate of Heaven is still held by the Imperial throne. That cannot be allowed, and thus the governors must be given the opportunity to crush the rebels and restore order in the Emperor’s name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160001;Anarchy in the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160001;Crush them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB160001;Out with the Manchu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160002;We have crushed the ‘Heavenly Kingdom’, and proven to all of China that the Qing Dynasty yet maintains the Mandate of Heaven. We will abide no more insurrections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160002;Taiping Rebellion Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160002;Victory is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160003;Even though we are not yet done with the ‘Heavenly Kingdom’, the fact the rebels have forced us to a ceasefire and have not been crushed is being taken by our Chinese subjects as a sign of weakness. Officials are predicting rebellions in many other places in the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160003;Truce With the Heavenly Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160003;Unacceptable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160004;Though we are not yet done battling the hated Manchu, for the moment the Heavenly Kingdom claims victory. We have forced a truce, and now the Manchu will need to deal with rebellions across their land as the people realize their mandate to rule no longer exists. All the world watches us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160004;Truce With the Manchu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160004;Hooray!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160006;The continued existence of the Taiping rebels is an embarrassment to the Qing government and our Emperor. Calls have been made for the war to resume, and this time for a national effort be started to draft men into the Qing army. There will be considerable resistance, but the Emperor has decreed that the Heavenly Kingdom must be destroyed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160006;The War Against Taiping;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160006;The war must continue!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB160006;We cannot afford the repercussions of a draft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160007;The truce with the Qing Emperor has come to an end, and already the calls have begun for the Taiping Revolution to continue. The Manchu must be thrown down! All of China must be freed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160007;The War Against the Manchu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB160007;We are not ready to wage such a war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160008;We have overthrown the hated Manchu and taken control of all China. Now, as the world watches, the true test comes: transforming the nation into the true Heavenly Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160008;The Taiping Are Victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160009;A troublemaker has arisen in the southern lands. According to reports, this man claims to have received a vision to the effect that he is the younger brother of Jesus Christ and was sent to rid China of the corrupt Manchu Qing Dynasty rulers. He has been winning converts to Christianity, and it seems there are many willing to listen to his words of sedition and join his so-called ‘Heavenly Kingdom’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160009;The Heavenly Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160011;Due to the low value assigned to the birth of daughters, female infanticide has become wide-spread across much of China. The practice has become so common, in fact, it has led to a shortage of women.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160011;The Female Shortage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160012;We have received reports of Christian missionaries in $PROVINCENAME$, followers of the so-called ‘Heavenly Kingdom’. Their actions would not be so objectionable if they were not also preaching sedition against the Manchu-and, far worse, though provincial governors have attempted to halt the missionaries this has only seemed to stir up support for them even further. There are sightings of their pamphlets all over $STATENAME$ now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160012;Taiping Missionaries in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160012;Collect the pamphlets and silence these missionaries-now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB160012;We shall tolerate this, for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160013;To many people in China, the Qing Dynasty is seen as ineffective and corrupt, ruled by Manchu foreigners. Bitter hatred has been stirring, particularly in the south. This is especially true in $STATENAME$, where there are reports of rioting after a recent confrontation between locals and Manchu officials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160013;Anti-Manchu Sentiment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160013;This cannot be tolerated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160015;He is of no consequence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160016;Reports have arrived at the palace that a firewood seller by the name of Yang Xiuqing has taken to walking the South lands, claiming to speak with the voice of God. Regardless of his seeming madness, the man has proven very effective at spreading the word of the so-called ‘Heavenly Kingdom’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160016;Yang Xiuqing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160017;Followers of the ‘Heavenly Kingdom’ are causing further problems in the south. They are already heavily fortified within $PROVINCENAME$, and many Qing advisors consider it completely beyond our control. Anarchy seems rampant, and all throughout $STATENAME$ these rebels are shouting treason. Can nobody do something about this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160017;Pro-Christian Riots in $STATENAME$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160017;This is starting to be a problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160020;The followers of the so-called ‘Heavenly Kingdom’ have spread their influence even further. According to officials in $STATENAME$, the Christian rebels have been spotted in $PROVINCENAME$ and sentiment against the Qing Dynasty is on the rise throughout the entire state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160020;The Taiping Sect Spreads!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160020;Hmm, that’s worrying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160025;Our beloved leader, the glorious and most holy Hong Xiuquan, has passed away-ascended into Heaven to receive his just rewards from God. Those of us who remain must now look to what will become of the Heavenly Kingdom without his guidance. There are some who say that his son, Hong Tianguifu, should be given the reins of power. Others say that Hong Tianguifu is a buffoon and that a republic is the way forward. Finally, a proper theocracy, without a hereditary rule, is another option that is considered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160025;The Death of Hong Xiuquan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160025;Establish a new dynasty under Hong Tianguifu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC160026;With our holdings on the mainland lost, all we have left is our stronghold on the island of Formosa. The suggestion among what little remains of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government is that we abandon $CAPITAL$ and move the capital to Taibei. This does not guarantee our safety by any means, but it may be the only means of survival we possess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME160026;Retreat to Formosa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA160026;It seems we have little choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160027;We no longer believe in the superiority of religion over state and must therefore rid ourselves of the moralist laws of our predecessors. China will no longer be dictated by the restrictive and oppressive laws that were proclaimed by the, so called, ‘brother of Jesus’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC160502;To many people in China, the Qing Dynasty is seen as ineffective and corrupt, ruled by Manchu foreigners. Bitter hatred has been stirring, particularly in the south.

EVTDESC164506;Water might float a boat, but it can also make it sink.’\n Chinese proverb\n \n The Huang He [Yellow River] is the great river on which our empire-or indeed our civilisation-has been build, sustaining the fields of the millions living within its course and China as a whole. Yet, like the god Hebo, the river is unpredictable and greedy, taking from those whom it uplifts and nourishes. A mighty system of dykes has been built along the river to channel and tame it, and protect those living along it-and China as a whole-from its greed. Sometimes though, it still lashes out and inflicts ruin on all those along its path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME164506;The Huang He Floods of $YEAR$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC164507;Despite all it brings to China, the Huang He river has also been called the Scourge of the Sons of Han, and with good reason: Throughout history it has flooded numerous times and inflicted unimaginable suffering on our people. Only a few years ago the river lashed out and killed hundreds of thousands, an event we are still recovering from. Few could have predicted the river to be so vicious and return so soon, yet it has. The Huang He has burst its dykes again, flooding the country side and shifting the river hundreds of kilometres to the north.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME164507;China’s Sorrow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA164507;But we haven’t cleared up after last time yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC164508;And once more the Huang He taketh, and more viciously than any time before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA164508;Not again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC164599;The forces of revolution have turned against the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Emperor. With dissent threatening to spread into chaos, leaders of the Beiyang army have demanded the Emperor abdicate his throne. Cheering crowds in $CAPITAL$ greeted the news, but few are aware of the forces now lining up to take control of the government. Kuomintang revolutionaries have demanded a transformation of $COUNTRY$ into a republic with free elections. Army leaders, however, have threatened to oppose the Kuomintang and demanded the republic be under strict Beiyang control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB164599;The Kuomintang will lead the republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC164600;Revolutionary societies are springing up all over China, and recently we have received word that several of these societies have banded together as the Tongmenghui or ‘Chinese United League’. Their stated goal is the revival of Zhonghua, or the concept that China should be a nation ruled by a republic that represents all of its various peoples. These revolutionaries wish to see $COUNTRY$ freed of foreigner influence, and do not seem satisfied to wait and see what reforms the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy will provide. What’s more worrying is that some of the regional warlords appear to be assisting them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME164600;The Tongmenghui;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA164600;Try to work with these societies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB164600;Crush them. This will not be tolerated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC164601;Revolutionaries seeking to bring down the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy have been stirring up a revolt in $STATENAME$. The incident appears to have begun in $PROVINCENAME$, after a demonstration by local workers turned violent. Though authorities have already moved in, the damage is done. What remains is to determine how we react to this outrageous provocation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME164601;Revolutionary Uprising in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB164601;Make minor reforms to appease the revolutionaries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC167000;Beginning with the Peasant’s Revolt of 1834 in Palestine, Druze nobles resented oversight. Their overlords considered them heretics and treated them as such. In the years following the Peasant’s Revolt, conscription was required in order to reinforce what the Egyptian army had lost in the revolt. In $YEAR$, Druze militias rose up against their Egyptian rulers in Hauran and defeated a 400-man force led by Ali Agha al-Busayli, the governor of Hauran. A number of other small expeditions followed but were unable to achieve any decisive victory. Druze from Mount Lebanon flooded into the Druze force as skirmishes continued for the next few months. Months later, the Druze were decisively defeated in the Wadi Bakka by Egyptian forces. Following this, Druze forces in Palestine looted the Jewish quarter of Safed while the main force moved south where they were decisively crushed at Shebaa and soon laid down their arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME167000;Druze Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA167000;Stop this revolt by any means necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC167010;Following years of servitude to Druze masters and heavy taxation, Maronite peasants revolted against their masters on Mount Lebanon. They were met by Druze irregulars who were supported by the nobility. Conflict has engulfed the region, with a number of massacres taking place throughout eastern Lebanon, and it seems like this is only just the beginning. Our officers are reluctant to get involved in Christian affairs, but are nonetheless moving their forces into the area. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME167010;Conflict on Mount Lebanon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA167010;This petty conflict does not concern us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB167010;We must stop this conflict before it is too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC167020;News that the Levant is engulfed in a civil war has reached the streets of Paris. Christians have been massacred and churches burned to the ground throughout Lebanon and Damascus. Ottoman forces have not done anything to quell the violence and only look on. In 1523, France swore that it would protect Christians living in the Near East from conflict and European powers have pressured us to stay true to our word. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME167020;$YEAR$ Mount Lebanon Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA167020;Send forces to restore peace and draft regulation to prevent this from happening again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB167020;Unfortunately, we are unable to intervene at this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC167030;Recent economic expansion has brought new business to the area around Jabal ad-Druze in Southern Syria. Such expansion has come at a cost as taxes need to be levied in order to pay for railroads and other infrastructure, which have angered the locals. A business dispute between a local Druze chief and $COUNTRY_ADJ$-supported business dealers. Our officers have mustered 35 battalions and have swiftly brought the revolt to an end, killing many of the region’s Druze inhabitants and disarming those who have surrendered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME167030;Hauran Druze Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA167030;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC168000;With special protection guaranteed to them by the French, the Maronite economy, driven by an increase in silk output, boomed. Pockets of Maronites were now filled with much-needed money and with it came a desire for better education and a population boom. For the first time, many women had an individual income and began to seek better conditions in both their work and in their general public life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME168000;Mount Lebanon Silk Boom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA168000;Great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC168010;With the openings of the Suez Canal and an increase in silk exports from Asian lands, the price of Lebanese silk halved and never recovered. The population boom that Mount Lebanon once experienced resulted in an elevated population that could no longer support itself on Lebanese soil. Many men and women migrated westward to seek better employment opportunities. While some of them came back years later, many permanently settled down in their new countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME168010;Mount Lebanon Silk Bust;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA168010;Damn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC168020;While visiting the hills around the Lebanese city of Baalbeck, some of our countrymen noticed a large number of Roman ruins which had been preserved in the dry environment. When they returned with this news, a team of archaeologists was dispatched to the site. They were able to document and catalogue a large number of artefacts from the site. The most notable of these include Persian pottery shards which date from the 6th century BC. These shards are adorned with cuneiform lettering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME168020;Ancient Ruins in Baalbeck;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA168020;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC168030;In the beginning of the 19th century, Lebanon had an increasing number of Western missionaries visit it. Many of these missionaries established school and printing presses in Beirut which catered to the city’s Christian population. Despite this recent surge, education was not a new concept for Lebanese Christians. A Syriac printing press was established in 1610 and Jesuits founded a school in 1624. American missionaries began their efforts in 1834 with another printing press and school. By the mid-1840s, it was noted by American missionaries that between a quarter and a third of men in Lebanon were literate and by the beginning of the 20th century nearly half of all Lebanese children could read, a feat which was hardly matched anywhere outside of the West at the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME168030;Missionaries in Beirut;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA168030;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC168050;A Kuwaiti general who is loyal to us brought the Sheikh of Qatar a number of Turkish flags. The Sheikh distributed them to his family members who flew them around the peninsula. The British, who believed that this was the direct doing of the Turks, felt that their Gulf holdings were at risk of Ottoman seizure and deployed a gunboat to the coast of Qatar. In response to this, the Sheikh of Qatar has sent a representative to request soldiers and equipment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME168050;Qatar Requests Protection;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA168050;Promise them protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB168050;We cannot guarantee protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC168060;The burden of Ottoman bureaucracy and rule has sparked an uprising in our Qatari dominion by Qatari nobles. Our officials in the Baghdad Vilayet dispatched soldiers to quell this rebellion who laid siege to the fort at Al Wajbah. Our soldiers were unable to take the fort and retreated back to our fort in Shebaka where the Qataris laid siege to it. After their water supply was cut off by the rebels, our soldiers surrendered and were given an opportunity to leave the peninsula in exchange for freeing Qatari prisoners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME168060;Qatari Unrest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA168060;Blast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC168070;The question of our Qatari dominion has once again reared its ugly head. What will the future of Qatar be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

They say it would damage the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ reputation and is best to deal with these matters internally. An ongoing government investigation has failed to find any culprits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME169001;Hundreds of Thousands Killed in $COUNTRY_ADJ$-led Massacre;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC169001;During my few days of service in this government I’ve learned of a few secrets and have come across something interesting. The deportation order was issued through official channels by the minister of the interior and sent to the provinces. Following this order the Central Committee circulated its own ominous order to all parties to allow the gangs to carry out their wretched task. Thus the gangs were in the field, ready for their atrocious slaughter… The ‘mission’ in the circular was: to attack the convoys and massacre the population… I am ashamed as a $COUNTRY_ADJ$. What a stain on the reputation of $COUNTRY$, these criminal people…\n The first-hand report of a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ defector made the newspapers headlines of one of the Great Powers. Soon, more evidence started to appear: in $CAPITAL$, senior government officials scramble to contain the damage of the damning report.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC190401;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has requested excavation rights to look for the ruins of Mycenaean Greece. While we ourselves do not have the know how or money to fund a serious excavation of the area, and allowing a foreign contractor might be good for that reason, it might also be best to let the secrets of Egyptian history lie undisturbed until such a time when we ourselves can find them.
